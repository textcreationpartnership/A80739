         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou art here preſented with a little Work, intituled, <hi>Divine Drops: Drops</hi> indeed they may be called, being but <hi>ſmall</hi> in quantity; but <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> for their <hi>quality,</hi> as thou ſhalt eaſily perceive, if thou peruſe them with a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> eye. They were ſeveral ſhort Exerciſes of the worthy <hi>Author,</hi> delivered in <hi>publike</hi> before his <hi>Sermons;</hi> wherein thou ſhalt finde many <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> which may not onely
<pb facs="tcp:117675:3"/> tend to thy <hi>ſpiritual profit,</hi> but <hi>delight,</hi> the work being interwoven with <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>ſubjects.</hi> It is like a pleaſant <hi>Garden,</hi> wherein thou mayeſt gather choice of <hi>ſpiritual flowers:</hi> In one Bed thou ſhalt finde the juſt <hi>anger</hi> of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by ſin, in another, the <hi>confidence</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> in God their <hi>refuge;</hi> in another, the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> diſcovered; in another, the <hi>comfort</hi> of Gods people proclaimed; in another, (if I may ſo ſpeak without offence) the ſpiritual <hi>fondneſs</hi> between God and his Saints deſcribed; and in all, that which may by the help of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> tend to thy <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had ſpared my pains in prefacing, but being informed, that ſome (though very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily) have incenſed the <hi>Author</hi> againſt the <hi>publiſhing</hi> of theſe things: For the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> and my <hi>ſelf,</hi> I have adventured theſe few lines. The <hi>work</hi> was not gotten out of my hands, without the <hi>importunity</hi> of divers <hi>godly men;</hi> who having formerly enjoyed the <hi>miniſtery</hi> of this Reverend <hi>Preacher;</hi> and now being deprived of <hi>it</hi> by his abſence, ſince they could not <hi>enjoy</hi> him as they would, deſired to have him preſent, as they might, namely, in the <hi>peruſal</hi> of ſome of his <hi>works;</hi> and I hope that
<pb facs="tcp:117675:3"/> ſhall not <hi>offend</hi> him, that may do ſo many <hi>good. Good</hi> is of a <hi>diffuſive</hi> nature, and the <hi>better</hi> the <hi>good,</hi> the more it is <hi>communicated.</hi> Some <hi>petty</hi> good things may be <hi>impropriated</hi> in the hands of a <hi>few,</hi> but the <hi>beſt,</hi> even <hi>natural</hi> good things (without which Creatures cannot <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist)</hi> are <hi>common</hi> to all, as the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Air, &amp;c.</hi> Good <hi>actions</hi> of good men (eſpecially that are intended for the <hi>publike)</hi> are like the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>water,</hi> wherein a ſtone is caſt; there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears firſt a <hi>little</hi> circle, which grows <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>greater,</hi> till it have overſpred the <hi>whole.</hi> And though theſe <hi>precious Truths</hi> were at firſt delivered in <hi>publike,</hi> yet the Walls of one <hi>Church</hi> could not contain many hundreds; whereas now by this means, the <hi>benefit</hi> may <hi>reach</hi> many thouſands. And as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks of corporal <hi>food,</hi> the <hi>loyns of the poor bleſſed him</hi> for it; ſo I doubt <note place="margin">Job 31. 20.</note> not, but the <hi>ſouls</hi> of many <hi>poor</hi> Chriſtians may have cauſe to bleſs the <hi>Author</hi> for theſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Viands, who never ſaw his face; and being <hi>written for the Generation to come, the people which</hi>

The <hi>main drift</hi> of it, is this, That here the <hi>Lord</hi> by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> threatens many, and grievous <hi>judgments</hi> that ſhould come upon this <hi>people;</hi> you ſhall ſee who they are in the Chapter. I ſay they were <hi>many,</hi> and they were <hi>ſore</hi> and <hi>grievous:</hi> And the <hi>Lord</hi> doth begin (as his uſual maner is) with <hi>ſome</hi> firſt, and with the <hi>leaſt;</hi> and when the <hi>people</hi> would not <hi>turn</hi> to him that <hi>ſmote</hi> them, then the <hi>Lord</hi> would ſend another <hi>plague</hi> on them: For that is the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>His hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi> They went on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117675:6"/> in <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and then the <hi>Lord</hi> ſends another <hi>plague, His hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi> The <hi>ſtretching out</hi> of <hi>Gods hand</hi> is the <hi>executing</hi> of <hi>judgment</hi> upon <hi>wicked people</hi> uſually: So that he goes on with very <hi>fore judgments,</hi> as here in this Chapter it is ſaid, <hi>A man ſhall eat the fleſh of his own arm,</hi> and yet <hi>the hand of the Lord is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi> A man would think that were the <hi>ſoreſt</hi> that could be; a man would think that were <hi>enough,</hi> yet notwithſtanding <hi>the hand of the Lord is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the maner of God throughout the <hi>Scripture,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The maner of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to, and in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to defer <hi>judgments</hi> a long while before they come, and when they come, he ſends them by <hi>degrees;</hi> but when they come, uſually they are <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>ſore;</hi> and it is uncertain when they will end, as we ſee in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. And here, and in ſome of the Chapters following, <hi>His hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt ſo <hi>(beloved)</hi> it is with us at this time, as I ſhall <note place="margin">Application to our times.</note> ſhew you briefly, (for I told you I would not <hi>expound,</hi> but take a <hi>word</hi> to quicken your <hi>hearts,</hi> and <hi>mine,</hi> that we may ſpeak unto the <hi>Lord</hi> more adviſedly.) You know, a little while agone, we thought that the <hi>Lord</hi> was coming to end the <hi>wars.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> gave us <hi>victory</hi> upon <hi>victory,</hi> after many corrections, and judgments before; and we thought they were now over, but we were <hi>deceived,</hi> as we were many times before. You know <hi>God</hi> hath been many times about to end our <hi>miſeries,</hi> but he hath <hi>ſent back</hi> for his <hi>mercies,</hi> and ſo he hath done now; he hath very ſtrangely <hi>called back</hi> his <hi>mercies,</hi> and <hi>loving kindneſs,</hi> and hath <hi>ſtretched out</hi> his hand many ways againſt us.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117675:6"/> God begins to raiſe up <hi>enemies</hi> again, and to ſtrengthen them; he ſuffers the <hi>enemy</hi> to break in among us, beſides all expectation: And how long, or how far God will <hi>ſtretch</hi> out his hand that way, who knoweth?</p>
            <p>Let me deal <hi>plainly</hi> with you: For this day we <note place="margin">The cauſe of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſought in our ſelves.</note> ſhould deal <hi>plainly</hi> with God, and our own ſouls; and however through the week we look for <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Cauſes</hi> of things in a natural way, who <hi>followed,</hi> and who were the <hi>Commanders,</hi> and what were the <hi>Forces,</hi> and the like: yet it ſhould be the <hi>buſineſs</hi> of this day to <hi>judg</hi> of things <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> to ſee <hi>ſpiritual Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we ſee in this Chapter, and many ſuch, That God <hi>ſtretcheth out his hand,</hi> while there is ſome <hi>continuation</hi> of ſins, or ſome new <hi>provocation</hi> againſt the Lord; therefore, (it may be <hi>God</hi> hath many more ends in it, as doubtleſs he hath, but) certainly there is ſome <hi>ſtrange provocation</hi> of <hi>God</hi> among us, that the <hi>Lord</hi> deals ſo with us again. And all this, that we may now ſee, that the <hi>miſeries</hi> that are beginning to riſe, they are but the <hi>ſtretching out of Gods hand:</hi> It is <hi>Gods</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Thoſe are wilful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſins.</note> 
               <hi>hand;</hi> and as of <hi>private perſons,</hi> ſo of <hi>publike Nations;</hi> it is not <hi>common frailties</hi> that grieve the Spirit, but ſome <hi>wilful wickedneſs.</hi> When a man hath ſin at the <hi>ſlaves</hi> end, and yet lets it come in to his <hi>boſome,</hi> and when he ſees ſin through the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> and yet opens the <hi>door,</hi> and lets it come in: So in a <hi>Nation</hi> it is not <hi>frailties</hi> and <hi>weakneſs;</hi> there will be <hi>whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> (though theſe provoke God.) It is not ſo much <hi>this,</hi> as ſome wicked <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> of God that are among us. Therefore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117675:7"/> in a word give me leave a little to tell you what I conceive, what I fear rather, what is the <hi>reaſon</hi> why God afreſh and anew <hi>ſtretcheth out his arme,</hi> when we thought his ſword was half <hi>put up,</hi> yet now it comes out again, and God knows how far it will go, or how long it will continue.</p>
            <p>Beloved, we ſhould be born with in <hi>ſearching</hi> our ſelves, and <hi>beholding</hi> and <hi>confeſsing</hi> our ſins, and the ſins of thoſe that are among us, eſpecially in ſuch days as theſe, unleſſe we will deale <hi>hypocritically</hi> with God, and proclaim a <hi>faſt day,</hi> and come to humble your ſouls, and no man look after his <hi>own</hi> ſins, and men not be allowed to bewaile the common ſins. I was conſidering, that the Saints before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their <hi>own</hi> ſins, and the ſins of <hi>others,</hi> of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>great ones;</hi> and the true <hi>prophets</hi> were bold to tell them alſo of <hi>their</hi> ſins. Therefore though I delight not (God he knoweth) of any thing to ſpeak of mens ſins; and if I do, the Lord he knoweth, I am more willing thorow his <note place="margin">What they are among us.</note> grace to ſee my <hi>own</hi> then <hi>any</hi> mans ſins, and to ſpeak of them and bewaile them. Therefore I ſay, I hope you will bear with me if I tell you my heart (if I now were on my death-bed) what I think (according to this bleſſed book) <hi>provokes</hi> the Lord that now ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly he <hi>threatneth</hi> us again when we thought his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was over. Therefore I pray hear me, I ſhall be brief.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that I fear highly provokes God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">1. A formal practice of penltential duties.</note> us (and as long as we <hi>ſtretch out</hi> this line of ſin, he will <hi>ſtretch out</hi> the line of wrath) That is, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>faſting</hi> and ſuch
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117675:7"/> like things. I do not ſpeak (neither can any man that hath charity think I ſpeak) againſt <hi>humiliation,</hi> or <hi>repentance,</hi> or <hi>faſting,</hi> I deſire to <hi>practiſe</hi> it: but our <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and theſe things, they grow every day more <hi>formall</hi> then other, that truly there is almoſt nothing but <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> in the eye of <hi>ſpirituall Chriſtians,</hi> and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to loath it, how much more the Lord who is a pure Spirit, whoſe eyes are <hi>brighter</hi> then the <hi>Sun?</hi> In <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. you ſhall read that the Lord <hi>puniſhed,</hi> and <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed</hi> the people, <hi>that there was no whole part in them from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot.</hi> Juſt as you do with an untoward childe, one while you <hi>ſtrike</hi> him on the head, another while you <hi>whip</hi> him, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while you <hi>cudgell</hi> him on the ſhoulders, till at laſt the childe be all <hi>bruiſed</hi> and <hi>wounded:</hi> ſo the Lord ſent for the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> he ſent <hi>ſickneſſe</hi> and <hi>famine,</hi> that the Lord had not left an inch whole, and the people were very devout for all that; they <hi>faſted,</hi> and <hi>prayed,</hi> and the Lord ſixteen times in that Chapter ſaith, <hi>I will none of them, away with them, they are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to me, they are iniquity.</hi> They were ſo far from being reconciled to God by this kinde of <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> and the like, that doubtleſſe they provoke God as much, if not more then any other way. Therefore <hi>bleſſed</hi> is that man or woman that mournes for this, not onely on this day, but ſecretly before the Lord, this <hi>formality.</hi> I fear the Lord may ſay to us as to thoſe people in <hi>Iſay</hi> 65. this people take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be holy, <hi>I am holier then thou, yet they are like ſmoke in my noſtrills all the day long.</hi> I fear our <hi>faſt dayes</hi> are the moſt <hi>ſmoky dayes</hi> in Gods noſtrills of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117675:8"/> all the <hi>dayes</hi> of the yeer. Therefore the Lord open our eyes, and the Lord finde a way to deliver us from <hi>formality</hi> in theſe things: If not, I fear the hand of God will be <hi>ſtretched out</hi> more and more. That is one thing that in my ſerious thoughts I think God is offended with.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as our <hi>formall humiliation,</hi> ſo our <hi>feigned reformation.</hi> It is the ſcriptures word as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhews, <note place="margin">2 A feigned reformation.</note> of <hi>reformation,</hi> It is that you have in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3. 10. ſaith the Lord, I corrected Iſrael, <hi>yet for all this her treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſiſte Iudah did not turn to me with her whole heart, but feignedly.</hi> Here is a great deal of ſtirre about <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> here is a great deal of <hi>cry,</hi> but a little <hi>reality.</hi> Look to our <hi>congregations,</hi> to our <hi>ordinances,</hi> to every thing among us, you may put all in a little piece of paper; There is a great deal of ſtirre about the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>mixed multitude,</hi> and the <hi>Service<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>book,</hi> and I know not what. We muſt ſpeak plainly before the Lord this day, there is a great deal of ſtirre, and abundance of people <hi>ſlain</hi> in the world, and <hi>ruined,</hi> and <hi>plundered,</hi> and Towns <hi>burnt,</hi> and all for <hi>reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and people think there is a <hi>glorious reformation,</hi> but God knows where it is, only there is a great ſtirre about it: therefore I ſay let every honeſt heart mourne before the Lord, we have ſhed <hi>reall</hi> blood, we have paid <hi>reall</hi> money we have taken <hi>reall</hi> paines, and brought upon people a world of <hi>miſerie,</hi> they have need to have ſome <hi>reall reformation,</hi> that they may have ſome <hi>reality.</hi> I ſpeak but a word, I deſire you even before the Lord that ye would think more of this then I ſpeak.</p>
            <p>The third thing among us that I fear draws out <note place="margin">3. Vices of miniſters.</note>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:117675:8"/> Gods hand ſtill, it is the <hi>flattery,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> and <hi>apoſtaſy</hi> of divers <hi>miniſters,</hi> Their <hi>flattery,</hi> that is, divers now are grown ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> and ſo <hi>diſcreet</hi> now in ſuch a time as this, when the Lord would <hi>teach</hi> us to ſee our ſins with a <hi>maul</hi> as we ſay, yet we will not <hi>ſpeak,</hi> we will not deal <hi>plainly,</hi> we will not <hi>tell men</hi> of their ſins: We have opportunity to tell <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>great ones,</hi> they would be told, and be thankfull: but we are apt to <hi>ſooth</hi> them, and to <hi>flatter</hi> them, and if they <hi>humour</hi> us as we would have them, they are <hi>brave</hi> men, <hi>zealous</hi> men, Oh, it is a ſad thing! Then the <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of miniſters every day growing more and more, eſpecially after a little <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> there is a deal of <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>ſtatelineſs.</hi> I have no pleaſure to ſpeak of theſe things, but I deſire that we ſhould be wiſer.</p>
            <p>And ſuch <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> ſuch <hi>ſhifting wayes</hi> to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliy <hi>livings,</hi> and to get <hi>eſtates</hi> in the world; theſe are too palpable.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>apoſtaſy</hi> of miniſters, There are diverſe miniſters that were <hi>comforts</hi> to Gods people before in the Biſhops times, that would preach the will of God, and comfort poor people: now there is nothing left but <hi>railing</hi> againſt Gods people, calling them <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> that it is a wonder to think. God ſees this grow more and more, and if he ſhould end our war and give us <hi>peace,</hi> we were undone. God will keep it up to help to pull down the <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>ambition</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to bring them down low to love their brethren, and to love <hi>honeſt hearts</hi> as before. The Lord do it, or elſe this <hi>war</hi> will never end, or the end will be as bad as if it had never ended.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:117675:9"/>
            <p> Another thing I fear, that there is a generall (put <note place="margin">4. Hardneſs of heart.</note> me in if you will: for I may put in my ſelf) <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> that grows on us againſt reproof; <hi>people</hi> even <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are grown ſo <hi>peeviſh</hi> that no body muſt <hi>reprove,</hi> or <hi>admoniſh</hi> one another for matter of <hi>judgement</hi> or <hi>life;</hi> none muſt tell another his <hi>fault,</hi> if he do, they will quarrell preſently, <hi>he that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pro. 29. 1.</note> 
               <hi>hardeneth his neek, being oft reprooved, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi> When <hi>men</hi> will not be told, <hi>magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>miniſters,</hi> and <hi>people</hi> when they harden themſelves daily that it is enough to impriſon a man with ſome kinde of people in the moſt loving, and ſincere way in the world to tell them of their faults. This is the time when <hi>a man is made an offender for a word,</hi> This is a miſerie: the Lord give us hearts like the bleeding heart of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Jer. 9. <hi>that we may weep and mourne in ſecret for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then fiftly, that that provokes God highly (I fear) <note place="margin">5. The vices of Officers.</note> is the <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> and <hi>perfidiouſneſs,</hi> among <hi>Commanders,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> That provokes God; as in reaſon it drew on the war, as in <hi>Germanie,</hi> the <hi>Mercinary</hi> ſouldiers; ſo alſo in a ſpirituall ſenſe. And it is to be feared that men grow to make a trade of <hi>war,</hi> and he that can get a good <hi>place,</hi> the longer the <hi>war</hi> holds the better it is, and ſo they have deviſes to make good his eſtate while he is in; and people learn every day to make a miſerable vertue of neceſſity, to make a ſweet, and fine life of our <hi>miſeries,</hi> and when they come to the <hi>work,</hi> then ſuch a one betrayed ſuch a <hi>Town,</hi> and ſuch a one betrayed ſuch a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and ſuch a one ran away from the <hi>Field,</hi> that coſt ten thouſand pounds before he came there. As it troubles us in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117675:9"/> 
               <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſo it provokes God; and Gods end to keep on the <hi>war</hi> may be to <hi>diſcover</hi> theſe wretches more and more, and to bring them to ruine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be any <hi>Officer,</hi> or <hi>Committee man,</hi> or <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> here, whatſoever thou art, thou art a <hi>curſed</hi> man if thy heart delight in <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>wealth</hi> that thou getteſt when they poor brethren and ſiſters are ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in this time of need. Take heed, it provokes God, and draws out the hand of God anew, and God knowes how far it will be drawn out.</p>
            <p>Then alſo there is another thing that I fear (for I <note place="margin">6. Breaches and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among the Saints.</note> ſpeak of <hi>great things,</hi> not of <hi>ordinary frailties)</hi> that is the <hi>tuchineſs,</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> among the <hi>Saints,</hi> that daily multiply and increaſe, and are no way cloſed, and ſome talk, but there are few that take a ſerious courſe to cloſe them in any meaſure. Now theſe <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi> and <hi>wranglings</hi> among the <hi>Saints,</hi> (whereas the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould be at peace, and by being ſo honour Chriſt by their union) by theſe open <hi>diviſions,</hi> many turn <hi>ſeekers,</hi> and many down right <hi>atheiſts.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> will not bear this, he will <hi>whip</hi> them together, Wo to thee that art a <hi>profeſſor,</hi> that delighteſt in having any thing to <hi>diſſent</hi> from thy brethren: ſome people are never well, but when they have <hi>crotchets</hi> wherein they <hi>diſſent</hi> from their brethren with delight: wo to thee, thou haſt a foul curſed heart; and though it be a <hi>truth</hi> and thou muſt needs <hi>diſſent</hi> from them, yet it would be a ſorrow to <hi>diſſent</hi> if thou hadſt a godly heart.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, ſuch a deal of <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> ſuch <hi>hereſies,</hi> for <note place="margin">7. Hereſy &amp; blaſphemy.</note> I may call them ſo (if any thing) ſuch <hi>errours,</hi> and groſſe <hi>ones</hi> increaſe daily, and hugely increaſe among
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117675:10"/> thoſe that ſeemed to be <hi>godly</hi> once and profeſſors, as denying the <hi>ſcriptures,</hi> denying <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> denying the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> calling <hi>God every thing,</hi> and <hi>every thing God,</hi> confounding God and the creature toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and abundance of ſuch hideous blaſphemous things, and they grow on wofully, eſpecially in our City: theſe things highly provoke <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> give us hearts, to mourne for them.</p>
            <p>Then there is another thing all along, I fear, that provo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s God, that is, the <hi>oppreſsion</hi> of the poor <hi>Saints</hi> 
               <note place="margin">8 Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> both in ſoul and body: that throughout this Kingdom as far as ever I could ſee or hear, in all theſe <hi>wars</hi> in any <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> if there be half a dozen poor <hi>Saints,</hi> they pay as much as the <hi>Malignants</hi> to our men, and the other ſide come, and <hi>ruine</hi> them; I never heard that they paid leſs, but more, beſide <hi>loanes,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions.</hi> Theſe things go high, and though we take no notice of it, there is one that takes notice of the cry of the <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> and the <hi>widdow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then our <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and <hi>hardneſſe of heart</hi> againſt the poor <hi>Saints</hi> in their diſtreſs, that every one thinks <note place="margin">9.

And this is too rife in this city, that we have not a conſtant care of thoſe poor people among us that are either <hi>ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> or <hi>inhabitants</hi> that are ready to periſh with want in theſe times.

            </p>
            <p>And in this Chapter, the <hi>Prophet</hi> comforts the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>believers:</hi> he gives them ſome comfort to ſupport their Spirits, when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould come in judgment againſt the wicked.</p>

            <p>And another thing is, <hi>In that day,</hi> when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall open his <hi>arms</hi> as a <hi>ſwimmer</hi> for <hi>judgment:</hi> The <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall have a ſtrong <hi>City,</hi> or <hi>Gariſon,</hi> or <hi>Refuge</hi> to go to, where they ſhall be ſafe. <hi>We have a ſtrong City</hi> (that ſhall be their ſong) <hi>Salvation will God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for Walls, and for Bulwarks.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let the <hi>judgments</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be out upon the <hi>earth,</hi> upon the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unbelievers</hi> never ſo much; and let the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> be never ſo <hi>miſerable,</hi> yet the <hi>Saints</hi> have a <hi>Gariſon;</hi> they have a ſweet place of <hi>ſhelter,</hi> of <hi>retreat,</hi> and <hi>refuge,</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> in the worſt of times that can be in this world.

            </p>
            <p>Truly, I have oft thought in my own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that the <hi>Saints</hi> differ as much from other men, as if you could ſuppoſe a man to live in the <hi>middle Region,</hi> where there is no <hi>wind,</hi> nor <hi>ſtorms,</hi> nor <hi>tempeſt:</hi> And you know here in all the <hi>ſublunary</hi> world, there is nothing but <hi>clouds,</hi> and <hi>rain,</hi> and <hi>ſtorms,</hi> and all <hi>weathers.</hi> If one were above in the <hi>middle Region,</hi> lot it <hi>rain,</hi> or <hi>thunder,</hi> or <hi>hail,</hi> or be what it will here, he is <hi>ſafe,</hi> and <hi>quiet.</hi> Juſt ſo it is with the <hi>Saints,</hi> they are in the <hi>middle Region,</hi> in a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> that though all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the world <hi>ſhake,</hi> yet they receive a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> that cannot be <hi>ſhaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, you will ſay, <hi>Where is this Gariſon, that</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117675:13"/> 
               <hi>we may go into it? Where is this Kingdom?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salvation</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>the Lord ſhall appoint us for walls and bulwarks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, this <hi>Kingdom</hi> is not outwardly to be found, it is not an <hi>earthly gariſon;</hi> but it is a <hi>figurative ſpeech,</hi> that they do finde in the <hi>Lord</hi> by the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> ſuch <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and ſuch <hi>ſafety,</hi> as if they were in a <hi>gariſon</hi> that cannot be aſſaulted or taken.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, How can that be? This is a meer <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>Notion,</hi> which no body can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew preſently, how it can be, by the help of <hi>God.</hi> The troubles of a man, the real troubles of a man, are in his <hi>minde,</hi> and <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi> Now if you could finde a way to keep a mans <hi>minde,</hi> and <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> it were eaſie to keep the <hi>whole man:</hi> For our trouble is not a little <hi>impriſonment,</hi> or <hi>poverty: Paul,</hi> or <hi>Sylas,</hi> were in priſon, and were to be hanged the next day, for ought they knew; <hi>yet they could ſing.</hi> The man is as his <hi>minde</hi> is; if we can finde a way to <hi>fortifie,</hi> and <hi>gariſon</hi> the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>minde,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> it will be eaſie to <hi>gariſon</hi> the <hi>whole man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, how ſhall we gariſon the <hi>minde,</hi> or <hi>ſoul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">How a man may be ſaid to be ſecure and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</note> or <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affections?</hi> to uſe no critical diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how ſhall we gariſon the heart of man?</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſee that in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and mindes, through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> There is (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) a peace of <hi>God</hi> that ſhall <hi>keep you,</hi> or as the word in the <hi>Greek</hi> is, <hi>gariſon you,</hi> ſhall ſet up a <hi>gariſon</hi> in your hearts, and mindes through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117675:13"/>
            <p> What peace is that?</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſee, if you compare it with the Goſpel of <hi>John:</hi> When our <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> was going to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> he told his <hi>Diſciples, I will ſend the Comforter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 14. 7.</note> 
               <hi>among you, and, My peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you.</hi> My peace I give unto you, not as the peace of the world. It is a <hi>legacy</hi> that we have in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that is now in <hi>heaven;</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> there is a kinde of <hi>peace</hi> that comes into the hearts of the <hi>Saints,</hi> that paſſeth <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> not onely the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of <hi>wicked men,</hi> that they know it not, and apprehend it not, but it paſſeth the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of a <hi>godly man</hi> that hath it. As we ſee in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> there is a peace that <hi>comes,</hi> and <hi>quiets,</hi> and <hi>ſecures</hi> his ſoul; ſuch a peace as he never <hi>underſtood,</hi> or did ſuppoſe could come into his ſoul, according to that, <hi>Neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai 64. 4.</note> 
               <hi>into the heart of man to conceive what God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that wait for him.</hi> That is, <hi>God</hi> ſends this <hi>peace,</hi> (and many other bleſſings.) Such a <hi>peace</hi> as a man never conceived in his heart; and this <hi>peace</hi> comes in, and keeps the heart like a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> or ſets up a <hi>gariſon</hi> in the heart, it keeps the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>minde</hi> through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <p> I am aſhamed, and troubled, and have been truly, many yeers, to ſee <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>godly people,</hi> when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles come on them, to ſpend their <hi>wits,</hi> and beat their <hi>brains,</hi> in finding <hi>refuge</hi> in outward things. O, if I were here, or there, in ſuch a <hi>Town,</hi> in ſuch an <hi>Iland,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Country,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>place,</hi> I ſhould have it.

Then let all the <hi>world,</hi> let <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> ſhake, I am ſure, I am ſafe; this is the way.</p>
            <p>It is a common ſaying of many particular perſons, Let a man not ſeek himſelf any where without, in the opinion of men: So let not <hi>Saints</hi> ſeek <hi>refuge,</hi> and <hi>ſhelter,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> in outward helps; but if they ſhould ſee the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (which <hi>God</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) involved in more <hi>miſeries</hi> and <hi>troubles,</hi> and <hi>deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, &amp;c.</hi> Lay this down alway by thee; there is a <hi>Kingdom</hi> that cannot be <hi>ſhaken. England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are <hi>ſhaken;</hi> but there is a <hi>Kingdom</hi> that cannot be <hi>ſhaken.</hi> Such a <hi>gariſon</hi> is beſieged, ſuch a <hi>Town</hi> is in danger, ſuch a <hi>place</hi> is ſtormed; but there is a <hi>gariſon,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath put into the hearts of his <hi>Saints,</hi> that cannot be ſtormed or aſſaulted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ply the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> by his <hi>holy comforter,</hi> that he would <hi>gariſon</hi> thy <hi>ſoul,</hi> and put <hi>peace</hi> there. And then what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117675:14"/> ſhall be the iſſue? I will tell thee, that thou with a holy <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>complacency,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> when thou ſeeſt the very pillars of <hi>heaven ſhaken</hi> (as it were) ſhalt ſollace thy ſelf in thy own <hi>gariſon,</hi> and walk in the ſtreets of it, and be ſafe; thou ſhalt triumph over all <hi>ſtorms</hi> and <hi>troubles,</hi> and all that is here.</p>
            <p>Not becauſe that a <hi>Saint</hi> is able to encounter thoſe things that are here: For a <hi>Saint</hi> is not able to anſwer, if you ask what he conceives will be the end of theſe things? he cannot anſwer theſe things; but onely he retreats to the <hi>middle Region,</hi> as a <hi>bird,</hi> he flies above ſublunary things; he can ſay, I cannot tell what ſhall become of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> but I am ſure I know a back door that leads into a <hi>Kingdom</hi> that cannot be <hi>ſhaken,</hi> to go into the <hi>middle Region,</hi> where no ſtorms of the Air ſhall trouble me; and there I can reſt my ſpirit.</p>
            <p>I alway, for my part (with ſubmiſſion to the wiſe) apprehend it as a thing too carnal, and too low for <hi>Saints</hi> to think to finde a <hi>reſting place</hi> in this world; any place is <hi>heaven;</hi> in ſuch an <hi>Iland,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſuch a place, let it be what it will. But a <hi>Saint</hi> that hath this <hi>gariſon</hi> in his heart and minde, he is at peace. This <hi>gariſon David</hi> had, when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies compaſſed him, and he had no <hi>walls,</hi> when there were 10000 about him, he lay and ſlept: <hi>For thou Lord ſuſtainedſt me,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>The ſalvation of God was walls and bulwarks about him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this peace of God be above underſtanding, how can it be otherwiſe, then be above expreſſion? We can therefore give but a hint of it; but ſuch a thing there is. The <hi>Saints</hi> walk in a <hi>green meadow</hi> by the

Salvation will God appoint for walls and Bulwarks; Open ye the gates that the righteous Nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſpeech juſt alluding to a <hi>Gariſon;</hi> they uſe there to <hi>open</hi> the gates, and to <hi>ſhut</hi> them; and when any body comes they bid them <hi>ſtand,</hi> and ask them who they are for?

               <hi>Open ye the gates,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord:</hi>

               <hi>The righteous Nation which keep the truth, they ſhall enter in.</hi>

            <p>The word in the Originall, it is <hi>Truth,</hi> not <hi>Truth,</hi> not one, or two, or three, or four <hi>truths, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>

            <p>Therefore will you now labour to be a <hi>righteous Nation</hi> to be <hi>upright?</hi> It is a word that hath ran much in my minde; ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, I am alſufficient God, walk before me, and be upright.</hi> I did not think there had been ſo much crookedneſs in the world as now I ſee.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shal endevor briefly to pick a leſſon or two out of this Chapter.

            </p>
            <p>Now the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> is but an <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>illuſtration</hi> of that. <hi>The Lord will come with his ſore, and great, and ſtrong Sword, to puniſh</hi> Leviathan <hi>the crooked Serpent, and to ſtay the Dragon in the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Leviathan,</hi> whatſoever it is (which is ſcarce known) onely we read in <hi>Job</hi> of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> one of the terribleſt creatures that <hi>God</hi> hath made.

            <p>The wicked that perſecute the <hi>Saints,</hi> are called <hi>Leviathan, the piercing, crooked Serpent:</hi> That is, thoſe <note place="margin">Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked</note> great enemies of <hi>Gods</hi> people, thoſe <hi>venemous, cruel enemies,</hi> thoſe <hi>crooked, deceitful enemies</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he will come with his <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>ſore,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong ſword</hi> to deſtroy them.

               <hi>wicked men</hi> that receive not <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but there is a way that thou mayeſt make that party on thy ſide, thou mayeſt make God on thy ſide, Take hold on him, that is, <hi>receive Chriſt,</hi> and then thou art in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and all belongs to thee upon that, and all the <hi>power</hi> whereby he made <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> and rules the <hi>ſea,</hi> and every thing, is thy <hi>power,</hi> it is for thee.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is like the expreſſion of ſome <hi>people</hi> that are wondrouſly given to <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and though other <hi>people</hi> deſire to <hi>quarrell,</hi> yet they will not <hi>quarrell,</hi> but they will be <hi>freinds:</hi> there is no neighbour ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, but they will be <hi>friends</hi> with them in ſpight of their <hi>heart;</hi> ſo ſayth God, <hi>Let them make peace with me, and they ſhall make peace.</hi> It is like that expreſſion of God, <hi>I will put my ſpirit in their hearts, and they ſhall keep my ſtatutes.</hi> That thy ſoul could creep along upon this bleſſed <hi>wall</hi> and make <hi>peace</hi> with him, and lay hold of his <hi>promiſe</hi> and he ſaith, thou ſhalt <hi>make peace!</hi>

               <hi>He ſhall cauſe them that come of Iacob to take root,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You ſee how ſweet God is in <hi>afflicting</hi> his <hi>Saints,</hi> how he <hi>preſerves</hi> them, and <hi>hears</hi> them in <hi>whipping</hi> them. Here he ſhewes three great differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">Three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the godly and wicked.</note> the afflictions of the <hi>godly,</hi> and of the <hi>wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is this, ſaith he, <hi>have I ſmitten him, as I ſmote thoſe that ſmote him?</hi> Or <hi>is he ſlain according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlain by him?</hi> That is, the <hi>Lord</hi> doth not lay ſuch a weight of affliction upon his <hi>children</hi> as he doth upon <hi>wicked people,</hi> that is one thing, therefore he ſtays his <hi>rough wind</hi> in the day of the <hi>eaſt wind.</hi> No <hi>eaſt wind</hi> blowes on the <hi>Saints:</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:117675:21"/> for in Scripture language that is the wrath of God. All the other winds are <hi>growing,</hi> but the <hi>Eaſt wind,</hi> is <hi>cutting,</hi> and <hi>chilling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is ſaid, <hi>God will debate with them,</hi> that is, beſotted carnall men, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and others, he layes afflictions upon afflictions upon them, and they never know why, it makes him a <hi>ſot,</hi> and <hi>he brayes him as a fool in a Morter:</hi> but <hi>I will debate with him,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will reaſon the caſe,</hi> As a father when he whips his childe, will you do ſo again? ſaith he, And, is this handſome? The <hi>Lord</hi> never <hi>whips</hi> his childe, but he <hi>debates</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the iſſue, and fruit of it, All the fruit is, he doth it to take away ſin, he will make all the <hi>ſtones</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> as <hi>Chalk-ſtones;</hi> he will beat them to pieces, that is, they ſhall pull down their <hi>Groves,</hi> and their <hi>Altars,</hi> as you do <hi>Chalk-ſtones</hi> when you <hi>burne</hi> them, and beat them in pieces.</p>
            <p>This ſhould make us ſweeten our thoughts of God; he is ſweet in his <hi>providence;</hi> in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> in his <hi>corrections,</hi> we ſee what a good <hi>God</hi> he is, how he draws water out of the Flint, he draws arguments of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> to ſave wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any way, in ſuch a way that if we were Judges we would condemn our ſelves.

            </p>
            <p>Here are four or five things noted of wicked men. <note place="margin">Four things obſerved of wicked men. 1. Their v. in conceits.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>we have made</hi> (ſay they) <hi>a covenant with death, and with hell we are at an agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning is not, that they did draw writings between them, and hell: for hell will make no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the meaning is, they were aſſured in their conceits that they ſhould be delivered from <hi>hell,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>miſery.</hi> As a man that hath made a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> for his land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hath got <hi>witneſſes</hi> to it, he hath made ſure, he hath it in <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white:</hi> ſo there was a fooliſh confidence in them; they aſſured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117675:22"/> that they ſhould eſcape, as if <hi>death</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> had given them an <hi>acquittance,</hi> and had <hi>ſealed</hi> it, and there had been <hi>Covenants</hi> drawn between them and the <hi>Devill.</hi> That is one thing.</p>
            <p>But, ſaith <hi>God,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Covenant with death ſhall be diſannulled, and your agreement with hell ſhall not ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, you ſhall ſee that all thoſe conceits are but vaine. Juſt as if a man ſhould go, and make a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with his neighbour, and buy his land, and he ſhould never tell his neighbour that he would ſell it, this <hi>agreement</hi> would be broken, and the <hi>Covenant</hi> would not ſtand. So, you build <hi>Caſtles</hi> in the aire, you make a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> in your conceits, that you are ſafe, and you hope the beſt, and <hi>God</hi> is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but the day will come when all this will be done away, As <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>it is juſt as a Spiders web,</hi> that is, a fine thing that ſhe hath been working all the week, and then the Maide comes to make clean the houſe, and all is taken away with one ſtroak of a bruſh.</p>
            <p>Another thing is, the <hi>Lord</hi> compares them here to <note place="margin">Illuſtrated in two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons.</note>

Do ye not think a man were mad that ſhould go and hide himſelf in a <hi>hole of a bridge,</hi> and ſleep when the tide was low, and then the tide come in and overwhelm him: So it will be with thee, if thou receive not <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>We have made lies our refuge, and under falſhood have we hid our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, they may be compared to little <hi>chickens,</hi> or <hi>partridges,</hi> that run their heads in a buſh, that hide their heads from the <hi>Hawk;</hi> the <hi>Hawk</hi> ſees all their bodies, onely <hi>in a conceit</hi> they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus, that is, they hide their own eyes that they may not ſee the <hi>Hawk:</hi> but they do not hide their <hi>bodies</hi> that the <hi>Hawk</hi> may not ſee <hi>them.</hi> So men ſhut their eyes, and have many conceits (O the <hi>Lord</hi> deliver us from it) this is the hope of <hi>wicked men, drunkards,</hi> and <hi>whoremongers,</hi> and <hi>ſottiſh creatures,</hi> that come not up to take <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord</hi> after compares them to little children <label type="milestone">

               <hi>The bed is ſhorter then that a man can ſtretch himſelf on it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As little <hi>children,</hi> when they hear <hi>thunder,</hi> they run under the <hi>ſheets and blankets,</hi> and think they are very ſafe: ſo we conceive that we ſhall be delivered. But truly all the ſhifts thou haſt, ſhall be no more to keep thee when the <hi>Lord</hi> comes on thee for a <hi>drunkard,</hi> or an <hi>unbeliever,</hi> or a <hi>perſecutor,</hi> then the ſheets, and blankets can keep them from a <hi>thunderbolt</hi> if God ſend it.</p>
            <p>I, but theſe were but compariſons, and the people were ready to mock the prophet for it: Saith he, <hi>Mock not, leaſt your bands be made ſtrong, for I have heard from the Lord a conſumption determined upon the whole earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give ear, and hear my voice, hearken to my ſpeech. Doth the plowman plow all day to ſow, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:117675:23"/>
            <p> This is the manner of the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> eſpecially when he ſpeaks of the <hi>miſeries,</hi> and <hi>judgements,</hi> that ſhall come upon <hi>people,</hi> he mingles comfort for the poor <hi>Saints.</hi> This he refers to the <hi>Saints</hi> that were <hi>upright.</hi> And to comfort them, he takes a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the <hi>Husbandman that plows</hi> the field. For the <hi>creatures</hi> are Gods <hi>Characters: God</hi> hath written his <hi>will</hi> in his <hi>word</hi> at large, and he hath written a copy of it (as it were) in the <hi>creatures,</hi> that by the one we might be enabled to underſtand the other. For we underſtand not one line of this bleſſed book any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we are taught. Now <hi>God</hi> hath ſo caſt things in this world, not only for the uſe and good of man, but he hath caſt things by his <hi>creation</hi> and <hi>providence,</hi> in ſuch a way, as that every thing might <hi>reſemble hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>God</hi> hath given <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> to the <hi>Husbandman</hi> to do this: the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>ordered</hi> the earth ſo to be <hi>plowed,</hi> and <hi>managed,</hi> and the <hi>corn</hi> ſo to be <hi>threſhed,</hi> that thereby we might have a ſhadow of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, comparing it with the bleſſed word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doth the plow man, plow all day?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">God deals diverſly with weak and ſtrong Saints.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What is the meaning of that? It is thus, you poor <hi>Saints, God plows</hi> you, and <hi>harrows</hi> you, and if the <hi>Lord</hi> follow you with <hi>one affliction after another</hi> (that whoſoever eſcapes, you ſuffer, if not without, yet within, and ſometimes you have both) you think <hi>God</hi> deals wonderfull ſtrangely with you, Sayth he, <hi>look on the plowman;</hi> if ever you ſee one plow, you will ſay, yonder man doth but <hi>plow,</hi> and <hi>harrow</hi> the land, and make it fit to <hi>ſow, Barly,</hi> or <hi>Oats,</hi> or <hi>Wheat,</hi> he hath ſome <hi>end</hi> in it: they are the <hi>common heaths</hi> that lie <hi>unplowed:</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:117675:23"/> but where there is <hi>good ground</hi> they <hi>plow</hi> it, and when he hath <hi>plowed,</hi> it is his diſcretion to <hi>ſow.</hi> So it is, that when the <hi>Lord</hi> continues <hi>his afflictions upon thee,</hi> thou ſhouldeſt conſider that <hi>God,</hi> that is thy good father, hath ſome gracious deſigne to ſow <hi>Barly,</hi> or <hi>Wheat,</hi> or <hi>Rye,</hi> to ſow ſome <hi>grace</hi> more: And what though he <hi>plow</hi> thee, or me, or another more then other men or women? Some lands are <hi>plowed</hi> thrice, ſome four times beſides the <hi>ſowing,</hi> they are ſo <hi>tough,</hi> and <hi>dogged.</hi> So ſome <hi>natures</hi> muſt be <hi>ofter,</hi> and <hi>deeper,</hi> and <hi>longer</hi> plowed.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſtare not ſo much upon the <hi>affliction,</hi> but conſider the <hi>gracious deſigne,</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to ſow thee, and to do thee good. Thou, and I have <hi>barren hearts,</hi> and there is little <hi>corn</hi> that is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him there: therefore he meanes by the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> that he layes on thee, by ſuch a <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> by ſuch a <hi>perverſe husband,</hi> by ſuch an <hi>ungracious childe,</hi> or loſſe of <hi>eſtate,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> means to ſow thy <hi>barren heart;</hi> and then bleſſed be his name. If the <hi>Lord</hi> do that, thou mayeſt well ſuffer him to <hi>plow,</hi> and <hi>harrow</hi> thee any way, with any inſtrument as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Then he takes another compariſon from threſhing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fitches are not threſhed with a threſhing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, the afflictions of the <hi>Saints,</hi> are alſo like the threſhing of <hi>corn:</hi> as there is no land that bears <hi>corn</hi> without <hi>plowing,</hi> no more can we enjoy it without <hi>threſhing,</hi> ſome more, ſome leſſe, ſome one way, ſome another. Now (ſaith he) in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117675:24"/> manner of afflictions you may obſerve two things from the threſhing of men; which was in another manner in thoſe countries then with us: It was trod out with the <hi>Oxe,</hi> and they did bring a <hi>wheel,</hi> and <hi>horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to ride upon their corne in thoſe dry countries, And ſome was beaten with a <hi>ſtaff,</hi> and ſmall <hi>corne</hi> they did <hi>whip</hi> out with a <hi>rod.</hi> So ſaith he, there are two things to be obſerved in the manner of <hi>Gods</hi> dealing, you that are <hi>weak people, weak Chriſtians,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> ſees that you are <hi>little Fitches: Fitches</hi> is a little graine, and <hi>Cummin</hi> eſpecially, <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls them little things; yet <hi>little</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians are like <hi>Cummin</hi> and <hi>Fitches, God</hi> will not bring a <hi>Cart wheele</hi> over them that ſhall bruiſe them to pieces, and make them worth nothing, but he will beat them with a <hi>ſtaffe,</hi> and the <hi>Cummin</hi> with a rod; that is, where there is a <hi>little, weak Saint,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> will take a little <hi>wand,</hi> a <hi>rod,</hi> a ſmall, light affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But bread corn is bruiſed becauſe he will not ever be threſhing it, not break it with the wheel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That is, ſometimes alſo God meanes to lay all the afflictions (as it were) at once upon his childe, where he ſees a ſtrong <hi>Saint</hi> many times he brings his <hi>horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and his <hi>cartwheel,</hi> as he did with <hi>Iob;</hi> you know <hi>Iob</hi> had but a bout, and ſo he goes over, and ſome of his days before and his days after were comfortable, <hi>God brings ſtrong afflictions upon his children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe God will not alway be <hi>threſhing,</hi> he will not alway <hi>afflict,</hi> for then the <hi>ſpirit of man would fail before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thy afflictions be <hi>light,</hi> ſay, I am a little <hi>Fitch,</hi> or <hi>Cummin,</hi> if they be <hi>heavy,</hi> ſay, they will be <hi>ſhort;</hi> for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117675:24"/> the Husbandman, though he deal more courſly with his <hi>Corn</hi> then with his <hi>Fitches,</hi> yet he takes it into his <hi>Barne,</hi> and laies it up ſafe: ſo though thy afflictions be <hi>ſore,</hi> thou maiſt from the practice of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſay, they will be <hi>ſhort:</hi> therefore indeavor to learn a little from <hi>afflictions,</hi> and how to carry and behave thy ſelf like a <hi>Saint,</hi> wait patiently upon <hi>God,</hi> to know <hi>Gods deſign</hi> and <hi>meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This alſo cometh forth from the Lord of Hoſts, which is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the meaning of that? That that made the Prophet cry out, that the Lord <hi>was wonderful in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and mighty in working it,</hi> was this, to ſee the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between <hi>Gods Works</hi> in his Books, and in his Creatures: O who would think when a man is plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there were ſuch a myſtery there! that he ſhould fetch a glorious myſtery in afflicting his <hi>Saints,</hi> from a little <hi>Cummin.</hi> This alſo is from the Lord of Hoſts, which is <hi>wonderfull in counſell, and excellent in working,</hi> that he reveales his bleſſed will in his <hi>book,</hi> and gives ſuch a glorious <hi>copy</hi> of it in the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> that we may underſtand the one by the other.

Holineſs</hi> is a bleſſed thing, and there are none deſire more <hi>earneſtly, ſincerely</hi> to be <hi>holy,</hi> then the <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament: Holineſs</hi> is upon the <hi>bridles of the horſes</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> yet there is a deſire of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> that is, legal <hi>faith;</hi> that by the earneſt deſire of <hi>holineſs,</hi> a man may ſee the frame of his <hi>faith</hi> to be legal.

Therefore truly, a man may deſire <hi>holineſs,</hi> more then <hi>happineſs</hi> (as you are wont to expreſs it.) He may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>holineſs,</hi> and to avoyd <hi>ſin,</hi> more then <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf, and any thing in the world.

            </p>
            <p>Why; what is the meaning of this? how comes this about?</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſoul</hi> reſolving to be juſtified, and to finde favor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117675:26"/> with <hi>God;</hi> partly by the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and partly by ſome <hi>grace;</hi> not that it hath, but that it hopes to have: Therefore the ſoul, as <hi>a Feaveriſh man reacheth out,</hi> and layes down this concluſion, I muſt be <hi>holy;</hi> and there are ſome things, if I <hi>could reach them,</hi> then I ſhould be well; and ſo the <hi>Feaver</hi> grows higher and higher. And <hi>God</hi> croſſeth him; for it is againſt the way of the <hi>Goſpel. God</hi> will do no good to us, if we go contrary to <hi>his</hi> glory: Therefore if we weep our hearts out, we ſhall not have it, for it is a <hi>deſigne</hi> of our own, ſaith <hi>God,</hi> You will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but you will have ſomething to make it up; you will <hi>believe,</hi> and be <hi>holy,</hi> but you ſhall go <hi>my way</hi> or not at all.</p>
            <p>Now a <hi>Saint</hi> that is according to <hi>Gods</hi> minde, firſt upon believing in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his righteouſneſs, his ſoul</hi> is fully ſatisfied, and <hi>he</hi> is at peace; He ſaith, <hi>Lord,</hi> whether I be <hi>holy,</hi> or not, I ſee a full <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to <hi>juſtifie</hi> me, and to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> me, and pacifie my <hi>conſcience.</hi> And <hi>Lord</hi> here I am, Thou knoweſt that I have nothing but my <hi>old nature;</hi> thou art <hi>wiſe;</hi> all my ſins are done away, do with me what thou wilt: If thou wilt put me to <hi>pain,</hi> or into <hi>pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or into <hi>Hell,</hi> or ſuffer me to go in <hi>rags,</hi> all my life long, do ſo: As a godly man ſaid, <hi>If pride, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs muſt have its work, though I had rather go to Hell for the time; yet here I am, I rejoyce in my ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am accepted of thee.</hi> So, here is a deſire of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but it is not <hi>Heatheniſh;</hi> as if a man could have no <hi>aſſurance,</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> in his <hi>ſoul,</hi> till he had gotten ſuch a <hi>degree of grace.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Feaveriſh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It appears to me, that your <hi>faith</hi> is not come to be right, by the <hi>defilements</hi> you have from the <hi>creatures:</hi> Your <hi>faith</hi> is not according to the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> When men are defiled with <hi>lawful things.</hi> Nay, ſo

So God ſaith, hypocrites are <hi>as a ſmoak in his noſtrills</hi> all the day long, that is as ſmoak in a Kiln, or in a ſmoaky houſe where there is a <hi>bad chimney,</hi> it is a wondrous trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thing, eſpecially if a man be driven to continue all the day, a man is not able to bear it, the ſmoak will fill his eyes, and his noſe.

The <hi>hearts</hi> of the Saints are touched with the ſame loadſtone as the <hi>heart of God,</hi> they <hi>judge</hi> as he <hi>judgeth,</hi> and as God ſaith, ſuch people are a <hi>ſmoak in his noſtrills,</hi> ſo they are in the eyes of the Saints, they curſe ſuch. They pity wicked men when blindly they go againſt the Saints: but when thou putteſt the <hi>beſt ſide outward,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to be <hi>holy,</hi> and thou knoweſt, thou couldſt <hi>eat</hi> all the Saints of <hi>God,</hi> and throw down the Worſhip of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> O there are many <hi>prayers</hi> againſt thee, and there is a <hi>harmony</hi> between the hearts of the Saints, and the heart of <hi>God.

               <hi>noſtrills,</hi> and ſo ſay the Saints. It grieves me more at the Jeſuiticall deſignes of ſome, then all the proceedings of the Cavaliers. Wo be unto them: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done in ſecret, but it ſhall be open, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpoken in the ear, but it ſhall be publiſhed on the houſe top; all their villany ſhall come out.</p>
            <p>And ſo in <hi>trading,</hi> a man muſt take heed of many profeſſors (I hope the generation of the Saints ſhall not ſuffer by it) in buying, and ſelling; a man were better deal with carnall men, then with ſome <hi>profeſſors</hi> in the City that I have knowen.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak this to thy comfort that art ſuch a one, though thou be the very heir of hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>they ſhall have their portion with hypocrites,</hi> as if hell were their inheritance, Yet for thy comfort know that an <hi>hypocrite</hi> is but a <hi>ſinner,</hi> though he be as far from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as any. For there is that that <hi>magnifies Chriſts love,</hi> he came to die for <hi>ſinners,</hi> and thy conſcience tells thee, I am the man that the miniſter meant, my <hi>trading is ſo,</hi> I know what <hi>accompts I keep,</hi> and what <hi>wares I ſell:</hi> though thou be, yet I truſt <hi>God</hi> means thee ſo well as to bring thee to Chriſt, and when thou art as bad as thou canſt be, think yet thou art but a ſinner, the <hi>Lord</hi> doth but rank thee among ſinners, learn this ſhort word, to ſee how hatefull hypocriſy is.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is not every Saint that is ſo; thou mayeſt be a Saint, and yet be a ſtranger to all that I am to ſpeak of from this text, But there is ſuch a thing. Becauſe a Saint, if he be a right Saint, you cannot put before him any pitch of grace and holineſſe, but he ſeeks to attaine it. As when <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples came into the companie of the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Johns</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples knew <hi>how to pray,</hi> and they did not, ſay they, <hi>Lord teach us to pray.</hi> So you need but put a <hi>higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace</hi> before a right-hearted Saint, and he will be <hi>ſick,</hi> and never be <hi>well</hi> till he hath it. Therefore I will preſent you with <hi>ſuch a temper</hi> that is in ſome Saints, that they are <hi>fond</hi> of God, with a <hi>holy,</hi> not with a <hi>ſinfull</hi> fondneſſe: as your children, they are fond of you ſometimes with a great deal of <hi>ſin;</hi> but this is a <hi>holy</hi> fondneſſe.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:117675:32"/>
            <p> Firſt I will ſhew you that it is ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will ſhew you which way God makes his children fond of himſelf.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt thing is this, that a fond childe will never <note place="margin">Proved in five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> ſuffer his father to go <hi>out of his ſight.</hi> Beloved, one may be a Saint, and yet may ſee his father, but as a <hi>childe at nurſe,</hi> once a quarter, or ſo. It is ordinary with the Saints, they ſee their father it may be at <hi>ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or at <hi>ſuch an ordinance,</hi> or <hi>in ſuch a private cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> where they have <hi>examined</hi> their <hi>ſoules;</hi> and it may be they do not ſee him in a fortnight after: and they make ſhift with grace received, with the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods love (when they ſaw it) and with a little help of the creature, and the comforts of the world, to hold up till they ſee him again: this is the life of moſt Saints. But there is ſuch a temper of a Saint, he is ſo fond of God that he will never let God go a <hi>moment</hi> out of his ſight, but he will <hi>cry</hi> after him. My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a word is this, that there is ſuch a temper, if thou and I had attained it, that God can never go out of <hi>ken,</hi> but I alwayes <hi>behold</hi> him, and ſee him alwayes <hi>beholding</hi> me in the face of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I am alwayes <hi>with him.</hi> See it in the Saints, <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>fond Child; Thou ſceſt my thoughts,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and my ſpeech, when I ſit down and when I riſe up,</hi> thou knoweſt all, and <hi>whether ſhall I go from thy preſence?</hi> It was not in a hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call way that he might <hi>flee</hi> from God: but <hi>when I awake I am alway with thee, When I walk abroad, I have ſet God on my right hand that I might not ſin,</hi> when a man is alwayes in <hi>view;</hi> when Gods eye is alwayes on him, and his eye alwayes on God, what a bleſſed thing is it! Such a Saint, <hi>let God but hide his face, and</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:117675:33"/> 
               <hi>he is troubled,</hi> let God go but one hour from <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſoul, and he is ready to cry out his <hi>heart,</hi> as we ſee in a fond childe. That is the <hi>reaſon</hi> there is ſo much carn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſſe in the Saints, that they have ſo many unſaint-like tricks, like the men of the world; Why? They go <hi>behind Gods back,</hi> they think God is <hi>a ſleep</hi> a while, and they may diſpatch their buſineſſe; whereas <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid, <hi>how ſhall I do this thing and ſin againſt God?</hi> God was in the <hi>view of him,</hi> when he was with that wretched woman: ſo a man would ſay, how ſhall I pretend my office is <hi>for the good of the publike,</hi> and for the <hi>glory of God,</hi> when it is to <hi>in rich my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?</hi> God may be out of <hi>ſight,</hi> and <hi>ken,</hi> and yet you may be Saints: but there is a more glorious life, when a man always walks in <hi>Gods ſight,</hi> God ſeeing him, and he ſeeing God. Theſe things are not for the <hi>head,</hi> but the <hi>heart.</hi> Now talk with thy <hi>heart</hi> a little, and ſee what is thy <hi>temper,</hi> and thy <hi>way,</hi> and if thou finde it not thus, tell God; the miniſter ſaid that there be Saints that live <hi>gloriouſly,</hi> that are <hi>fond of God,</hi> that are <hi>alway with him,</hi> ſleeping, and waking, at bed, and board, they are never out of his ſight. Lord make me ſuch.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another thing is, that a Saint that is grown fond of God, he will <hi>never be ſtill</hi> or <hi>ſatisfied with any creature.</hi> A childe that is not fond, you may give him twenty <hi>baubles</hi> whiles his mother goes to market, or doth other things, but if he be grown <hi>fond,</hi> a thouſand of thoſe will not <hi>ſatisfie</hi> him. So a true Saint hath <hi>much</hi> of God, and <hi>little</hi> of the creature; a man may be a true Saint, and be much upon the creature, but when the ſoul grows fond of God, no creatures,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117675:33"/> or <hi>rattles</hi> will ſerve, if God put the creature into his hand, he is glad, but if God be away nothing wil ſerve him: As a childe that is fond of his mother, give him a <hi>Rattle</hi> or a <hi>Cake</hi> while he is in her hand, he is glad, but nothing will ſtill him without her.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third thing is this, there is an exceeding <hi>boldneſs</hi> in a fond childe <hi>to ask any thing of his father,</hi> truly ſuch a <hi>boldneſs</hi> as were <hi>rude</hi> in a ſtranger; a childe will ſit in the <hi>lap</hi> of his mother, and <hi>ſnatch</hi> a thing out of her hand: So people may talk of <hi>forms</hi> how people ſhould pray, and ſtand half an hour confeſſing of ſins, and ſo come on by degrees, but one that is <hi>fond</hi> of God with an <hi>holy</hi> fondneſs, he knows he may <hi>leap</hi> into his fathers lap at any time, and <hi>fall</hi> into his arms, and ask any thing without <hi>courting,</hi> and <hi>comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There are ſome Saints that cannot at any time get to God, and ask any thing, but they have much ado to <hi>ſet their hearts,</hi> and to get off the <hi>guilt</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and God as a cloud; they have much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to get a little <hi>adoption</hi> to call God <hi>Father,</hi> and to lay hold on the <hi>promiſes:</hi> but there is ſuch a temper of <hi>holy fondneſs,</hi> that there needs not all, or any of this: God and the ſoul are ſo <hi>well acquainted,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways together, that as ſoon as ever he comes he can <hi>ask</hi> any thing, and in a holy boldneſs <hi>ſnatch</hi> it: for the <hi>Kingdom of heaven is taken by violence,</hi> therefore ſaith God <hi>concerning my ſons and daughters, Command ye me.</hi> A childe can <hi>command</hi> his father, and ſay, <hi>I muſt</hi> have a new coat, <hi>I muſt</hi> have a new book, or <hi>I muſt</hi> have a ball to play with: ſo a Saint can ſay, Father, there is a <hi>covenant,</hi> thou art <hi>my Father,</hi> and I am <hi>thy childe,</hi> it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117675:34"/> cannot ſtand with thy <hi>Truth,</hi> thou wert not juſt if thou ſhouldeſt <hi>deny</hi> me any thing that is good: O this is a holy <hi>boldneſs!</hi> As a childe can creep into his mothers breaſt, and pull it out with his hand, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is an inward love, ſhe <hi>bears</hi> with it, and <hi>ſmiles</hi> in his face. It argues a great deal of <hi>neerneſs</hi> to God when one is always in a <hi>readineſs</hi> to ask any thing. I have obſerved that ſouls that are far from God, they muſt always go upon their knees, but a ſoul that is neer can pray ſtanding, or walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or talking, as that good man that you read of in the Book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> he can pray with <hi>his hat on,</hi> he can pray <hi>in his bed,</hi> or where you will, when he is is communion with God. It is a moſt glorious thing, and a grace that I have ſeen in ſome Saints, and it hath made my ſoul ſick to have it, to have a ſoul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in ſuch a temper, they can ſpeak a ſpiritual word at any time, as it is ſaid of <hi>Bradford,</hi> to have a heart ſo <hi>familiar</hi> with God, that it can ſpeak in a <hi>moment:</hi> A <hi>weak</hi> Profeſſor prays, and he is put to it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for his duty in the morning, and he gos be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>Gods back</hi> all the day till night, and unleſs he ſet aſide all his work, and go upon his knees, he cannot pray as he <hi>buys,</hi> and <hi>ſells,</hi> and <hi>trades.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is in a fond childe <hi>a holie careleſneſs,</hi> of caſting himſelf, bodie, and ſoul, and familie, and buſines, and affairs and all upon God, <hi>Be carefull for nothing.</hi> It is not to make careleſs Chriſtians: but it is true in one ſenſe, when in a holie careleſnes, a man caſts himſelf upon God. It is your weakneſs, much of your diſpute, concerning <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>juſtification;</hi> a fond Childe of God ſmiles at
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117675:34"/> it; he can come <hi>near</hi> his father, and <hi>catch</hi> him, and <hi>hold</hi> him, and ſay, <hi>I know whom I have truſted,</hi> on whom I have layd my ſoul; As a man that puts his eſtate in another hands, can ſay, <hi>I know whom I have truſted,</hi> A weak ſaint thinks <hi>little</hi> of, and cares <hi>little</hi> for the ſervice of God; but he cares much for his owne ſafetie, and ſecurity, and ſalvation: a <hi>ſtrong, fond</hi> ſaint takes leſs care for his <hi>owne ſalvation,</hi> but he cares much for the <hi>ſervice of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> For (thinks he) let the Lord Ieſus look to that; he hath taken on him to <hi>die</hi> for my ſoul, and he hath promiſed to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it;</hi> and he hath ſayd he will not caſt away <hi>them that come to him,</hi> I have <hi>caſt</hi> my ſoul on him, ſink or ſwim, I will not trouble my head with that, but all my thought, and care ſhall be how I may pleaſe Ieſus Chriſt, and love and glorifie him. It is a bleſſed pitch of grace when a ſaint can come to that careleſſnes, that a man is not thoughtfull for his ſoul, when he hath brought it to Chriſt, leave it there, and think not of it, but think of the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of Chriſt, and how to honour him. As ſuppoſe you meet in the way as you travell, an enemy, a man that (it may be) ſtands there to <hi>deſtroy you,</hi> though you meet him you know not his <hi>purpoſe,</hi> if you did, you would go ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; now when you meet the man, there is one of theſe two things to be done, either concerning your ſafetie, or your carriage to Chriſt. Now a ſaint is apt to take <hi>Chriſts</hi> work, and lay aſide his own; another man doth not care in that caſe, how he is <hi>pleaſing to Chriſt,</hi> and carries himſelf to him; but his care is how he may <hi>get off from his enemy,</hi> that he may not kill <hi>him,</hi> and take away his life: that is our errour; we ſhould
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117675:35"/> leave that to <hi>Chriſt, he</hi> hath put an enemy before me, and he cannot kill me without <hi>Chriſt</hi> give him power: but my care ſhould be, how to be pleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> and ſo to ſpeak, and think, and do. As for outward things, and for the body; ſo for the ſoul, my care ſhould not be ſo much whether I ſhall be damned, or ſaved: I know into whoſe hands I have put it; but my care ſhould be, how to <hi>walk more holily</hi> and pleaſing to Chriſt, and for the <hi>edification of his Church and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> this a childe that is fond of <hi>God</hi> will do.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, a Saint that is fond of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> he ſeeth <hi>ſomething of God in every thing.</hi> As they ſay of <hi>love,</hi> one that is in love, ſees nothing with <hi>her eyes,</hi> nor <hi>hears</hi> nothing with <hi>her ears</hi> but love: ſo a Saint that is fond of <hi>God,</hi> bring him meat, he ſees the <hi>love of God in Chriſt</hi> in it; bring him cloathes, or any thing, his eye is faſtened more upon the <hi>love of God in Chriſt,</hi> then upon the thing. As the ſpouſe in the Canticles (for the Canticles is a book of <hi>fondneſſe</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his people) ſhe <hi>hears</hi> one talk, I warrant you (ſaith ſhe) <hi>this is the voice of my beloved;</hi> ſhe is ſo fond of <hi>him,</hi> that ſhe could not <hi>hear</hi> one talk, but ſhe ſaith, <hi>It is my beloved,</hi> when ſhe looks on the <hi>gallery,</hi> and the <hi>lattice,</hi> I warrant you (ſaith ſhe) <hi>my beloved looks thorow that grate,</hi> and when <hi>ſhe ſleeps, her heart waketh.</hi> It is a bleſſed thing when we do not eye things in themſelves, but ſo as we are able to ſee <hi>God</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>And you ſhall know it by the <hi>various tempers</hi> of your ſouls: for ſometimes you are more <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and ſometimes more <hi>carnall:</hi> when you are <hi>carnall,</hi> you uſe more of the <hi>creature,</hi> and never ſee <hi>God</hi> at all; but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117675:35"/> when you are <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> you ſee <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>love in Chriſt</hi> in every thing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſhew you how <hi>God</hi> brings his children <note place="margin">This fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought four wayes.</note> to <hi>this holy fondneſſe,</hi> and I would leave you <hi>longing</hi> for it; and I <hi>truſt</hi> in <hi>God</hi> to leave ſome <hi>ſouls ſick,</hi> till <hi>God</hi> work, and bring up their ſouls to that; I will name but onely four.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing is, that <hi>God utterly convinceth a Saint</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. By diſabl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Creation to this end.</note> 
               <hi>of the vanity of every creature,</hi> and <hi>of every condition,</hi> he will never be <hi>fond till then: God</hi> lets him <hi>ſuck</hi> one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after another, and then he ſees the <hi>vanity of them. God</hi> puts him into one <hi>condition after another:</hi> O, ſaith a Saint, when he is <hi>ſick,</hi> if I were <hi>well,</hi> I ſhould rejoyce, and glorifie <hi>God: God</hi> gives him <hi>health,</hi> and then he is in a <hi>worſe temper.</hi> When he is poor, ſaith he, If I had to <hi>pay my debts,</hi> and to <hi>ſet up handſomly,</hi> then I ſhould <hi>ſerve God; God ſets him up,</hi> and lets his heart go after cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and ſaith to him, Doſt thou not ſee that thou art <hi>worſe</hi> then thou wert before? So <hi>God</hi> chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him from <hi>one creature to another,</hi> and from <hi>one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to another.</hi> If he would be in the <hi>Country, God</hi> convinceth him that he will be worſe then in the <hi>Town;</hi> At laſt he ſaith, <hi>Lord,</hi> I have <hi>tried,</hi> and <hi>hunted</hi> all, and I ſee they are a company of <hi>vanities.</hi> And ſometime when he is <hi>ſick in body,</hi> and <hi>ſhaken in ſoul, God appears gloriouſly,</hi> and makes <hi>the worſt condition better then the beſt:</hi> ſo <hi>God follows,</hi> and <hi>traſeth,</hi> and <hi>chaſeth</hi> him from one to another, till <hi>he</hi> bring him to ſee <hi>every creature vanity,</hi> and every condition; and, ſaith a Saint, <hi>I do not much care what condition,</hi> whether he put me in <hi>priſon,</hi> or at <hi>liberty,</hi> whether I be <hi>rich</hi> or <hi>poor; well</hi> or <hi>ſick,</hi> ſo <hi>he</hi> reveal <hi>himſelf</hi> to my ſoul. You will never
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:117675:36"/> be <hi>fond</hi> till you come to that, till <hi>God convince</hi> you of all conditions, and of the uſe of <hi>all creatures,</hi> and <hi>tire</hi> thee that thy <hi>ſoul</hi> may ſay, <hi>God is all in all;</hi> I am <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> what creatures I have, or <hi>want,</hi> or what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am in: <hi>for I have ſeen God to be all in all,</hi> I have ſeen nothing in <hi>riches,</hi> and in <hi>liberty,</hi> but as <hi>God comes</hi> into a <hi>condition,</hi> or is <hi>abſent,</hi> ſo it is <hi>ſweet</hi> or <hi>bitter, good,</hi> or <hi>bad.</hi> People that are <hi>profeſſors</hi> in theſe <hi>ſad times,</hi> they would not be ſo <hi>reaching,</hi> and <hi>griping and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,</hi> for <hi>offices,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>preferments,</hi> and I know not what, if they did ſee this.</p>

               <hi>pour</hi> out a <hi>Paile,</hi> or a Bucket of water; <hi>God</hi> ſo <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> with his <hi>love,</hi> that there is no <hi>guilt,</hi> no <hi>hardneſs,</hi> no <hi>fear,</hi> no <hi>ſpirit of bondage</hi> at all left in the ſoul. Beloved; why are not we more <hi>fond</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> why is not <hi>he</hi> more <hi>deare</hi> to us? The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have many <hi>hard thoughts of him,</hi> that he may be an <hi>enemy</hi> as well as a <hi>friend,</hi> and I know not <hi>what he</hi> means: I look upon <hi>him</hi> at a <hi>catch,</hi> as with a <hi>ſtaffe in his hand</hi> to ſtrike me. There are abundance of thoſe <hi>thoughts</hi> in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>affliction;</hi> ſome <hi>profeſſors</hi> are ready to ſay, <hi>God hath found me out as an hypocrite, and plagueth me.</hi> In afflictions, ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors <hi>looſe</hi> more, though they talk of <hi>getting.</hi> But the <hi>Lord</hi> comes to ſome of his children, and ſo <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> with his <hi>love,</hi> that there is not one <hi>thought nor imagination</hi> in their <hi>hearts,</hi> but onely of <hi>love</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and then they will be <hi>fond:</hi> for when they ſee <hi>pure love in God,</hi> and nothing but a principle of <hi>pure love in them to God;</hi> what ſhould hinder but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117675:36"/> they ſhould be <hi>fond one of another?</hi> There is a homely compariſon, a woman that hath <hi>butter</hi> in a <hi>diſh,</hi> ſhe melts ſome of the <hi>butter;</hi> but if ſhe take it <hi>too ſoon</hi> from the fire, there will be a <hi>core,</hi> a <hi>knob</hi> in the <hi>diſh</hi> left, and being taken from the fire it grows bigger, till all be hard. So a weak <hi>Saint,</hi> by ſtudying the promiſes of <hi>God,</hi> and the love of <hi>God,</hi> it diſſolves much of the <hi>knobbineſse,</hi> yet there are ſome hard <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,</hi> and <hi>ſuſpitions:</hi> but <hi>God</hi> comes at laſt, and <hi>melts</hi> all the <hi>butter</hi> together, all the <hi>knobbineſſ</hi> that is in the <hi>heart,</hi> every <hi>thought,</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> of <hi>terrour,</hi> and <hi>guilt,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> that there is a clear, and <hi>pure principle of love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and then the ſoul is <hi>fond</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>The Lord takes a great deal of delight to <hi>train</hi> and <hi>bring up</hi> his childe to be <hi>more in love with him:</hi> God will ſo traine and bring him up, that if he throw him into the worſt condition that can be for body, or ſoul, and ſhall ſay, what thinkeſt thou of me now? haſt thou any hard thoughts of me? ſaith <hi>God:</hi> No, ſaith the ſoul, <hi>all is Love.</hi> As for inſtance, I will tell you a thing, the worſt on this ſide hell, I ſpeake not of <hi>impriſonment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or <hi>ſhame,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> may take him, and leave him to ſin, and then the ſoul awakes, and thinks, <hi>good Lord where am I? O what a hell have I in me!</hi> for there is a <hi>hell</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> take off the <hi>vail</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> if he <hi>draw the Curtain,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>hell</hi> in the <hi>ſoul:</hi> There are many ſins that thou haſt committed, that there is not a <hi>ſoul</hi> in the world that hath committed worſe. This is true, ſaith a <hi>Saint,</hi> and doſt thou not think, ſaith <hi>God,</hi> that thou art an <hi>hypocrite?</hi> and that I ſhall <hi>damn</hi> thee for this? No, ſaith the <hi>ſoul,</hi> I know I have nothing in me but of <hi>thy</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:117675:37"/> 
               <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>if thou draw the Curtain,</hi> all is <hi>hell;</hi> but there is <hi>nothing but love,</hi> even then after <hi>ſin,</hi> there is not one hard <hi>thought,</hi> it makes the <hi>ſoul</hi> more <hi>fond:</hi> he ſaith, it is true, I am ſo, and there is no <hi>devil</hi> that hath worſe <hi>thoughts,</hi> but the more need I have to go to my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for I am thy <hi>ſon,</hi> I am ſure of that; and ſeeing that I am <hi>weaker</hi> then I was, I have the more need to betake me to <hi>thy lap,</hi> and into <hi>thy arms,</hi> and ſo he grows more <hi>fond</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>ſin</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nay, I will tell you a greater then that. What can that be? There is one greater, and yet all this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fondneſs</hi> that is between the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> that is, when <hi>God</hi> corrects his <hi>childe</hi> with <hi>one</hi> ſin for <hi>another:</hi> It may be for his fault <hi>he</hi> lets him run to <hi>covet Places</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> &amp;c. and the next day after, the Lord ſuffers <hi>another luſt</hi> to carry him as in a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> to <hi>hell,</hi> that this may make <hi>him take heed</hi> how he looks after ſuch things. This is the worſt between this and <hi>hell</hi> ſaith <hi>God:</hi> Should I not now <hi>come,</hi> and break thee <hi>in pieces</hi> as a <hi>villain?</hi> No, ſaith the <hi>ſoul,</hi> this is a wiſe <hi>deſign of thy love,</hi> and there is nothing but <hi>love</hi> in <hi>thee</hi> to me, and there ſhall be nothing but <hi>pure love</hi> in me to <hi>thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Learn theſe things, beloved, There are many that come to <hi>hear,</hi> and all that I can ſee from them, is, that if there be controverſal, they diſpute of that when they come home, but lay theſe things to <hi>heart,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> and beg of <hi>the Lord</hi> to ſcrew up your <hi>ſouls</hi> to <hi>that heavenly, bleſſed Life,</hi> that you may attain in this world. <note place="margin">3.

            </p>
            <p>The third <hi>thing,</hi> before which a <hi>Saint</hi> will never be <hi>fond,</hi> is, <hi>God</hi> will convince him of an <hi>abſolute, perfect</hi>

And <hi>this</hi> is by <hi>faith:</hi> for by <hi>ſenſe ſin</hi> prevails over us, <hi>and if we ſay we have ſin, we do not ſay true.</hi> But by <hi>faith,</hi> when <hi>Satan</hi> is moſt <hi>ſevere, he</hi> is <hi>conquered,</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> when it is moſt <hi>violent, he</hi> looks on it as a <hi>vaſſall</hi> at <hi>his foot,</hi> intreating <hi>pardon.</hi> It is ſaid in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to <hi>bring in everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and make an end of ſin.</hi> A <hi>Saint</hi> by <hi>faith</hi> ſees <hi>ſin ended,</hi> as <hi>hell,</hi> and <hi>damnation,</hi> and <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>the curſe</hi> is ſo, <hi>ſin ſhall be out of doors.</hi> There <hi>is no damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt. He hath redeemed us out of the hands of our enemies, that we might ſerve him without fear,</hi> as Zechary ſaith, from all our enemies: and <hi>he ſhall</hi> (as Malachy ſaith) <hi>tread his enemies as aſhes under his feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that that keeps a Saint under, he cannot come to the height of love to <hi>God;</hi> becauſe there is ſome <hi>enemy that over-tops him.</hi> This day, when he hears that our <hi>ſouls are over ſin,</hi> he is cheary: but when he comes home, there comes <hi>a ſin</hi> or a <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and breaks all, and he is at a loſs. Now when faith is ſcrued ſo high, as to <hi>tread on all enemies,</hi> on ſin, which is the ſtrongeſt: ſay it be a ſtrong <hi>temptation</hi> of <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> thou ſtudieſt to <hi>purchaſe</hi> and to <hi>enlarge thine inheritance:</hi> ſuppoſe there be ſuch a thing in thy <hi>ſoul,</hi> and it is violent, and thou haſt offered to reſiſt it, and thou canſt not: thou mayſt ſay, <hi>Sin, though thou be ſtrong, and I cannot put thee cut, thou haſt bolted the door,</hi> but thou art my <hi>ſlave,</hi> and in the blood of

               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I am thy <hi>conquerour;</hi> thou thinkeſt to <hi>conquer me,</hi> but thou art <hi>my vaſſall</hi> and <hi>my ſlave. And</hi> much more may he ſay ſo of <hi>Satan;</hi> Thou <hi>moleſteſt</hi> me, but thou art <hi>condemned,</hi> I am made <hi>Lord over thee</hi> in the blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Grace, and ſin will mount as the bird and the <hi>Hawk,</hi> and the one ſeek to out-mount the other: the bird for ſafety, the <hi>Hawk</hi> for prey: ſo grace and ſin get one <hi>above</hi> another. O, ſaith grace, I would be holy: ſaith ſin, thou ſhalt be <hi>covetous.</hi> I will pray, ſaith grace; but I will make thee my <hi>poſſeſsion,</hi> ſaith ſin. When the ſoul out-mounts ſin, to the place <hi>where dwelleth righteouſneſſe,</hi> that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that <hi>cannot be ſhaken;</hi> that I ſee all my enemies <hi>beneath:</hi> and when they are moſt ſtrong, and imperious over me, I look on them with a <hi>peaceable</hi> &amp; <hi>quiet ſpirit</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſt of all, and ſo I have done with this; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this the ſoul could not be <hi>fond</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but <note place="margin">4. By a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ad heſion to the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> as <hi>God</hi> gives him a <hi>ſpirituall underſtanding of the new Covenant;</hi> the enemies will over-mount the ſoul elſe. As for inſtance, to give you but one illuſtration, there are ſuch <hi>pangs,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>temper</hi> in the ſoul of a Saint, as that ſometimes, nothing in the world can give him ſatisfaction; there is <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>temptation,</hi> and it may be <hi>paine</hi> in body: and where is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and any thing to help? <hi>God</hi> can help, but who knows whether he will or no? now I am in the hands of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: In comes the <hi>Covenant,</hi> O (ſaith the ſoul) it is true, I am in the hands of mine <hi>enemies,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> may <hi>chuſe</hi> whether he will reſcue me. He <hi>might</hi> have done, but now he is bound in an <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> that (with reverence) God <hi>muſt</hi> help: time was when <hi>God might</hi> have caſt me to hell, and he was <hi>not bound</hi> to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:117675:38"/> ſave me, but the caſe is <hi>altered,</hi> God is <hi>bound</hi> to ſave me. Therefore ſaith <hi>David, Though my houſe be not ſo with God, yet there is a Covenant, this is my deſire, and joy.</hi> Many times, the ſoul is ſo that nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it but the <hi>Covenant</hi> that God is bound, that <hi>God</hi> cannot though he would deſert him.</p>
            <p>If you examine, what this <hi>Covenant</hi> is; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is? The <hi>Lord</hi> knows we are apt to <hi>meaſure</hi> him by our ſelves, and ſo we do in every thing: we think our thoughts, as Gods thoughts, and his thoughts as ours: therefore God is willing to <hi>condeſcend</hi> unto us in our own way: for that <hi>God</hi> that <hi>contrived</hi> a way of <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> before the <hi>world</hi> was, we may not fear but that that love will carry us thorow: but <hi>God</hi> would come in our way, and take that way that one man doth with another: becauſe we are apt to meaſure <hi>God</hi> by our ſelves, therefore he comes and ſaith, and if that ſerve not, he ſwears, and if that will not ſerve, he brings a ſeal, and a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and then with <hi>men</hi> a man is ſafe enough: So, <hi>Gods word</hi> had been enough; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhould have <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> that muſt be conveyed according to our <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> and <hi>thoughts:</hi> there God <hi>ſaith,</hi> and <hi>ſwears,</hi> and makes a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>binds</hi> himſelf, that we may ſee him <hi>bound.</hi> Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle in the <hi>Galatians, If it be but a mans Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, none can diſſanull it.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I made this for your ſakes, or elſe I have one, and none can alter it: but foryour ſakes I came down, and made a <hi>Covenant</hi> like men; and <hi>There are three that bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and that is enough among <hi>men:</hi> therefore think my love will be <hi>conſtant</hi> to the end. So when a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is at a dead lift, this relieves him, not that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117675:39"/> God can ſave him if he will, but that God <hi>muſt,</hi> he is <hi>bound</hi> to ſave him.</p>
            <p>It is a pitifull thing, when a man is in the hands of a thouſand enemies; and then can only ſay, <hi>peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God</hi> will ſave me and reſcue me, but when the ſoul ſees that God <hi>muſt</hi> reſcue it, and there is a <hi>Covenant</hi> made, and <hi>ſealed</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and it is not poſſible to be broken, Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> is to ſave me, and <hi>preſerve</hi> me to his <hi>everlaſting Kingdom.</hi> Thus I have briefly ſhewed you that <hi>fondneſſe</hi> that is between a Saint, and God; and the book of <hi>Canticles</hi> is (as I told you) nothing but a book of <hi>fondneſſe</hi> (as I may ſay) between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Saints. Therefore you ſhould aime at the good of your ſouls, and ſeeing there is ſuch a condition, that there are Saints that are ſo, deſire the <hi>Lord</hi> to make you ſuch.</p>

            <p>You ſhall read in <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 4. and in <hi>Num.</hi> 30. 15. that by the counſell of <hi>Balaam</hi> the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought to commit Idolatry at Baal-peor, <hi>Iſrael joyned himſelf to Baal-peor; and the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael.</hi> They were brought firſt to <hi>whordom,</hi> and then to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as we may ſee in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> for which God <hi>cut off</hi> men and women about ſome twenty four thouſand.

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:117675:41"/> 
               <hi>me;</hi> that is, they had been kind to her ſons and to her, for they lived in a ſtrange country, now Farwell, <hi>The Lord grant that you may finde reſt, each of you in the houſe of her husband: Then ſhe kiſſed them, &amp;c.</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>ſurely we will return with thee to thy people, we will go along, we will not leave thee, No,</hi> daughters (ſaith ſhe) <hi>do not ſo, for I cannot bear other children for you to marry,</hi> as the law was then. <hi>If I ſhould lie to night with an husband, and have children, you would not ſtay ſo long, therefore I pray abide, and go not.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Orpah kiſſed her mother in law, and lift up her voice, and wept,</hi> and left her, but <hi>Ruth clave unto her. Orpah</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and wept, and <hi>took her leave,</hi> but <hi>Ruth clave</hi> to her, and ſaid, <hi>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whether thou goeſt I will go, and where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God my God, Where thou dyeſt will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do ſo to me and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and me.</hi> So I ſay you ſee here, that when there was a <hi>competition,</hi> a kind of <hi>parting,</hi> then <hi>Ruth</hi> abiding with <hi>Naomi,</hi> that is called cleaving.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>glorious thing,</hi> that when the ſeeming <hi>ſervants</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The honour of cleaving to Chriſt.</note> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall <hi>depart</hi> from him, when there is a <hi>diviſion</hi> among <hi>profeſſors,</hi> then to be able to <hi>cleave</hi> to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> That you may <hi>underſtand</hi> it, <hi>conceive</hi> that in the wayes of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> many times there are ſuch times that <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>hypocrites</hi> as <hi>well</hi> as <hi>Saints</hi> abide with him, they are ſometimes <hi>ſtill,</hi> like the waters of <hi>Shilo,</hi> there is no <hi>perſecution</hi> or <hi>trouble</hi> in them, it may be there is a great deal of <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> with them, and many times a great party of the <hi>world</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:117675:42"/> ſticks to him; but there is a little tripp, and ſtep in the ways of <hi>godlines,</hi> when there is a <hi>parting,</hi> when <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> like <hi>Orpah,</hi> ſhall <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> and ſo ſhall go with <hi>Chriſt no longer:</hi> if they do, one ſhall looſe his friends, another his trade, another his wife, and ſhall lift up their <hi>voices</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>take their leaves;</hi> then is the beautie of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and the <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> of a Chriſtian, to be able to cleave to the <hi>Lord</hi> in ſuch a time as this is. This was the exhortation of the <hi>good</hi> man <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that he gave to the people, as you ſhall read <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 22, 23. <hi>When he was come, and had ſeen the grace of God, he was glad, and exhorted them all that with purpoſe of heart, they ſhould cleave to the Lord. I have oft marvailed with my ſelf, why Barnabas,</hi> that is ſaid <hi>to be a good man, and full of the Holy Ghoſt, coming as a ſtranger to a congregation of good people, where he ſaw the grace of God among them;</hi> why he ſhould chooſe this and no more, but onely pitch upon <hi>this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that ſeeing they were <hi>godly,</hi> and had received the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> he ſhould ſay; I have no more to ſay but this one word, underſtand it well, that is, that with full purpoſe of heart you cleave to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Indeed the reaſon was (as I conceive) if you <hi>compare</hi> it with <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Barnabas</hi> was a man to whom God had <hi>diſcovered</hi> much of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>perſecution</hi> that belonged to the Goſpell. For take notice of it by the bye, I look on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>God,</hi> li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the ſervants of <hi>God</hi> that did go to <hi>build</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſome were appointed to <hi>hew ſtone,</hi> ſome to <hi>digge</hi> them up, and ſome to <hi>carry</hi> them home, ſome to <hi>build</hi> them up, ſome to <hi>caſt accounts</hi> and to keep reckoning. So the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> in his <hi>Kingdom</hi> (no man
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:117675:42"/> knows the reaſon why) <hi>he cuts out diſtinct parcells of work to his people,</hi> and thereupon ſupplies them with his ſpirit, and reveales truthes to his people, ſome to manage ſuch a <hi>thing,</hi> no man knows the reaſon. God faſtens the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>juſtification</hi> upon ſome, that they cannot reſt <hi>night</hi> nor <hi>day,</hi> and one that may be unwilling to <hi>die</hi> for another point, but not for that: Another about <hi>Church-government,</hi> Another upon <hi>ſanctification,</hi> none knowes why; but <hi>God</hi> fits them for their work by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> according to his bleſſed will.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ſhould not <hi>cenſure</hi> or <hi>ſleight</hi> godly men becauſe our maſter doth not imploy them about ſuch a <hi>work,</hi> as he doth us. It may be my thoughts are upon <hi>ſanctification,</hi> anothers upon <hi>juſtification.</hi> So God <hi>cuts out the work as it pleaſeth him.</hi> Now this <hi>Barnabas</hi> it ſeemes did not ſpeak much as we read of, but he had a mighty apprehenſion of <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions</hi> and <hi>tribulations</hi> that the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould ſuffer in this world. Therefore in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. he and <hi>Paul</hi> confirm the ſouls of the Diſciples, exhorting them to <hi>continue in the faith, and that we muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> In every Sermon (as we may ſay) <hi>Barnabas</hi> had ſomething to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the ſouls of the people to <hi>go thorow tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi> and <hi>affliction,</hi> It may be another <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had his Spirit upon <hi>another</hi> work. It may be in reference to this he gave them this <hi>exhortation,</hi> deſiring them with full purpoſe of heart to <hi>cleave to the Lord,</hi> As if he had ſaid, Now you are in <hi>proſperity</hi> (for ſo they were) and are all ready to hear the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. O (ſaith he) but there is a time a coming,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:117675:43"/> to <hi>trie</hi> you, and you muſt not think to run to <hi>heaven</hi> between two <hi>feather-beds:</hi> but as all the <hi>Saints</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had their ſhare, ſo <hi>every one that will live in Chriſt Ieſus muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> As there is a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in heaven for <hi>all men once to die;</hi> ſo if you be <hi>Saints,</hi> you muſt <hi>live in tribulation,</hi> and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is the way; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made perfect by ſufferings, ſo you muſt come to ſalvation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thoſe things come, I have not much to ſay to you, but O then remember <hi>to cleave</hi> to the Lord: for then you ſhall ſee <hi>hypocrites</hi> in droves go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and leaving him, one ſtumbling at this, another at that; one is offended at the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> that it takes away his <hi>credit,</hi> another for his <hi>profit,</hi> another his <hi>liberty,</hi> another his <hi>trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> but brethren, I beſeech you with full purpoſe of heart to <hi>cleave to the Lord.</hi> See how a company in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. with <hi>one word ſpeaking</hi> went all away from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> If they had been called to <hi>fire</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it had been ſomething; but he ſaith no more, but <hi>you muſt eat my fleſh and drink my blood,</hi> and they all <hi>went away.</hi> Yet the Diſciples (there was twelve then) ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Will ye go away alſo? Lord, whether ſhall we go?</hi> ſaith Peter, <hi>thou haſt the words of eternall life:</hi> ſo they <hi>abode</hi> with him, and <hi>clave</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>Saith <hi>Barnabas, with full purpoſe of heart,</hi> that is, you muſt not <hi>cleave</hi> as <hi>Iudas:</hi> for <hi>Iudas</hi> did then <hi>cleave</hi> to Chriſt, when all but the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left him, <hi>that we read of,</hi> but with <hi>full purpoſe of heart,</hi> the <hi>Greek word</hi> ſignifies with <hi>full decree of heart,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> had, when they <hi>decreed</hi> to caſt <hi>Daniel into priſon,</hi> though the <hi>King</hi> were otherwiſe <hi>minded,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>There are two <hi>great times</hi> in generall when people <note place="margin">2. Speciall times of cleaving to God. 1. In a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deluge of ſin.</note> 
               <hi>leave</hi> God, and then you muſt be ſure to <hi>cleave</hi> to him, that is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>when a generall time of ſin comes up among you, as</hi> this of <hi>Baal peor,</hi> there were twenty four thouſand <hi>ſlaine,</hi> for their ſin at <hi>Baal-peor;</hi> ſin when it comes up once, is like a <hi>ſtreame;</hi> truly the courſe of the world is but the <hi>ſtreame</hi> of ſin in the world, and worldly men. Therefore you ſhall ſee that ſins in <hi>Nations,</hi> though they begin from <hi>little,</hi> ſee how men are <hi>carried away</hi> with them when once they are <hi>grown ſtrong!</hi> when once <hi>people</hi> begin to be <hi>proud and high,</hi> and <hi>ſet themſelves up,</hi> every one ſhall be ſo.

This pride is <hi>grown</hi> to a <hi>ſtreame</hi> in the <hi>world:</hi> and ſo for <hi>ſwearing,</hi> and ſo for <hi>drunkenneſse,</hi> and every other ſin. Now I ſay, when ſin doth in this manner <hi>break</hi> out, and thou ſeeſt others carried with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117675:44"/> it more and more, then take heed, then be ſure thou <hi>cleave</hi> to God. Nay, there are more ſpirituall ſins then theſe, as it is ſaid, <hi>Barnabas was carried away with the diſsimulation.</hi> When thou ſeeſt <hi>generall diſsimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Kingdom,</hi> to call <hi>darkneſſe light,</hi> and <hi>light dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>good evil,</hi> and <hi>evil good,</hi> to call <hi>good men treacherous,</hi> and <hi>treacherous men good,</hi> to call <hi>blinde, baſe, ſuperſtitious men Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox men ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> take heed then that thou <hi>cleave</hi> to the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Laſtly, he lays down the <hi>end,</hi> why he ſo <hi>prayed</hi> or <hi>prepheſied,</hi> to wit, that <hi>his enemies might be filled with ſhame,</hi> that they might <hi>ſeek the name of the Lord,</hi> that they might be <hi>brought home to God.</hi> Or if they will <hi>go on</hi> and <hi>periſh,</hi> that <hi>others</hi> may know the name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that they may <hi>know</hi> that thou whoſe name is <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, art moſt high over all the earth.</hi> And though <hi>their faces being filled with ſhame,</hi> they will not <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> yet doubtleſſe <hi>others</hi> will; and when God ſhall bring <hi>confuſion</hi> on his <hi>enemies,</hi> others will <hi>acknewledge</hi> the name of the <hi>Lord Iehovah,</hi> and that there is <hi>no other</hi> in the whole earth.

            <p>Firſt, concerning the <hi>prophets complaint,</hi> the <hi>prophets waking</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as it were in thoſe his complaints.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And you muſt take notice, and it is worth obſerving, that when the <hi>prophet</hi> ſaith here, <hi>O God,</hi> he means <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> That whereas <hi>ordinarily</hi> in the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:117675:45"/> eſpecially in the book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> when you hear the <hi>prophet</hi> mention <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or the <hi>Lord,</hi> you think of <hi>God</hi> naturally, <hi>out of Chriſt,</hi> whereas he uſually means <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> as I could fully cleare it if I had time. Let me give you one inſtance; In the laſt verſe of the former <hi>Pſalm: Ariſe, O God, judge the earth, for thou ſhalt inherit all nations.</hi> That is clearly meant of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for we know that <hi>God</hi> inherits all <hi>Nations;</hi> he made the world, and he had the command and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it: but to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> there is a time when <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed that <hi>he ſhall inherit the nations, from the uttermoſt ends of the earth.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here by <hi>God</hi> is meant <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For indeed, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> you ſhall not finde a <hi>people conſpiring againſt God properly:</hi> you ſhall ſee no wicked man but in ſome ſort or other he will <hi>ſpeak honourably</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> but <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt, God</hi> in the <hi>mediator,</hi> God in the <hi>Goſpell, God</hi> in <hi>his Saints,</hi> God in <hi>Goſpell ordinances,</hi> and the like: hence are all the <hi>tumults</hi> in the world, and all the <hi>conſpiracies</hi> againſt God, and his <hi>Saints.</hi> Therefore if you compare this place, <hi>Thine enemies make a tumult againſt thee,</hi> with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Why do the heathen rage? Or why do they make a tumult?</hi> (as ſome read it) <hi>and why do the people imagine a vaine thing? the Kings of the earth take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell againſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed.</hi> That is meerly meant of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So take notice of that, that <hi>carnall</hi> men ordinarily do not ſpeak or think evil of <hi>God abſolutely</hi> conſidered, but the worſt of <hi>men</hi> ſpeak <hi>well</hi> of him, when he gives them <hi>wealth</hi> they <hi>thank</hi> him, when he gives them <hi>faire weather,</hi> they <hi>bleſſe him;</hi> when he gives them <hi>peace</hi> and preſerves them in their

            <p>You ſee the <hi>prophet</hi> looks upon God as one that in the midſt of theſe <hi>conſpiracies,</hi> did <hi>keep ſilence,</hi> and <hi>hold his peace,</hi> and ſit ſtill; Not that God doth uſe to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> or to <hi>ſtir properly</hi> as we men do: but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, that many times when his ſon <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>laws;</hi> and his <hi>ordinances</hi> are moſt conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, God (as it were) doth keep ſilence, I meane <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when his people, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are conſpired againſt, he keeps ſilence, and ſits ſtill, as though he would let his enemies do what they would, and what they liſt; as though God did not ſee or heed which end did go forward. The Lord oft doth this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keep not ſilent O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember that place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 27. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou O Iacob, and ſpeakeſt O Iſrael, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſſed over from my God?</hi> The meaning of it is this, that when the enemies of God, as we ſee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 39. did oppreſſe this people, they did <hi>pray</hi> to him, and looked for <hi>aſsiſtance</hi> from him, but he was <hi>ſilent</hi> (as it were) or <hi>aſleep:</hi> therefore they begin to ſay in their heart, <hi>My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſſed over from my God:</hi> that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:117675:46"/> is, Surely it is impoſſible that God ſhould eye, and ſee my wayes, and how men deal with me while I am <hi>believing,</hi> and <hi>waiting,</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>humbling</hi> my ſoul; no, <hi>my way is hid from the Lord, and my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is paſſed over from my God;</hi> that is, my God hath forgotten to <hi>give ear</hi> to me. Beloved, there is a time when the Lord (as it were) gives cauſe to his people ſo to think; that he is (as it were) <hi>aſleep,</hi> and lets their enemies go on, and none contradict them. I was thinking out of ſcripture that there are three Reaſons <note place="margin">3. Reaſons of Gods ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the danger of the Saints. 1. To try their faith.</note> why the Lord keeps <hi>ſilence</hi> when his people are in danger, and <hi>ſits ſtill</hi> when there is moſt need to give help and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>One is, the <hi>Lord</hi> doth it <hi>to trie their faith,</hi> as we ſee clearly, <hi>Matthew,</hi> 8. 23. where it is ſaid that our Lord <hi>Chriſt was aſleep, There aroſe a great tempeſt, inſomuch as the ſhip was covered with waves, but he was aſleep; and his diſciples came and awaked him, ſaying, Lord ſave us, we periſh.</hi> We read more fully in <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. he left them, when the ſhip was covered with waves, and they were rowing for their lives, their Lord was <hi>aſleep</hi> the while, and he ſaid to them, <hi>Why are ye fearfull, O ye of little faith? Then he aroſe, and rebuked the wind, and the ſea, and there was a great calm.</hi> Truly, the Lord will not ſuffer his people to be <hi>overwhelmed,</hi> that is certain, but he will ſuffer them to come very near, that the waves <hi>cover</hi> them, and fear and horrour ſhall <hi>cover their ſouls,</hi> and all to <hi>try their faith.</hi> For faith is the <hi>evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> take it in all ſenſes, take faith for the ſoul or faith for the body; and we live not here by <hi>ſenſe</hi> but by <hi>faith;</hi> and as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of hope, ſo we may ſay of faith, <hi>If we ſee, why do we yet</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:117675:47"/> 
               <hi>hope?</hi> If we did ſee <hi>God</hi> preſent ſtriking of <hi>wicked</hi> men when they conſult againſt his <hi>children,</hi> this were <hi>ſenſe;</hi> men would ſee that it were better to <hi>ſtick to God</hi> then otherwiſe, and there would be a world of <hi>hypocrites</hi> as Doct. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith: for every man would be a <hi>profeſſor.</hi> But God ſeems to <hi>ſleep</hi> ſometimes and <hi>keeps ſilence,</hi> and <hi>leaves</hi> his people as he did this poor fiſhing boat here, to ſee if when they <hi>ſee nothing</hi> they will keep faith to him.</p>
            <p>I do find another reaſon in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59, and that is, the <note place="margin">2. To try their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</note> 
               <hi>Lord</hi> doth keep ſilence in the midſt of the troubles of his people, as to trie mens faith, ſo <hi>to trie mens upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> who will ſtick to God: as to ſee who will ſtick to God by faith, ſo, who will ſtick to his cauſe, or his people out of <hi>uprightneſse of heart.</hi> For if God ſhould alwayes <hi>appear</hi> for his cauſe, God and his cauſe ſhould have many <hi>favourites and friends:</hi> but ſometimes God <hi>leaves</hi> his cauſe, and <hi>leaves</hi> his people; and <hi>leaves</hi> his <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and his ordinances to the wide world, to ſee who will plead for it, and ſtick to it. As you ſee in that place of Iſaiah. <hi>Tranſgreſsions are multiplied</hi> ſaith the prophet) <hi>in tranſgreſsing, and lying againſt the Lord, departing from our God, and uttering words of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, judgement is turned back, and juſtice ſtandeth afar off, truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter, Yea, truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a prey. And the Lord ſaw it,</hi> God was as it were <hi>aſleep,</hi> but he <hi>looked through the lattice, the Lord beheld it, and he ſaw that there was no man, and he wondred that there was no interceſſor.</hi> That is, God ſuffered all this truth to faile, and Juſtice to fall back, and every thing to go to wrack and ruine: God would ſee if any man
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117675:47"/> would <hi>intercede,</hi> any man among our Magiſtrates or Miniſters, or Citizens, if any man would plead for <hi>God,</hi> and for his people, and for his truth, but he ſaw none and wondered. Truly <hi>God</hi> wonders, and men may wonder to ſee what abundance of people follow <hi>God,</hi> and good lives in the time of <hi>proſperity,</hi> and when <hi>adverſity</hi> comes, and wicked men, and al the powers of hell <hi>conſpire</hi> againſt godlineſſe, to ſee how few ſhew themſelves for <hi>God, God</hi> wonders at it. <hi>Therefore his arm brought ſalvation unto him, and his righteouſneſſe, it ſuſtained him: he put on righteouſneſſe as a breaſt-plate, and an helmet of ſalvation upon his head, and he put on the garments of vengeance for cloathing, and was clad with Zeale as a cloak.</hi> The Lord comes and Arms himſelf, juſt as valiant ſouldiers in the wars: when a party is gone forth, they <hi>ſtand</hi> to ſee what they do, how they come off: but if there be none that will ſtick to it, but run away, they <hi>buckle</hi> on their armour: So the <hi>Lord ſtands</hi> to ſee where is the man that will <hi>ſtick</hi> to it in theſe caſes, and if there be any, <hi>God</hi> rejoyceth in it, if there be none, <hi>God</hi> himſelf comes in.</p>
            <p>Therefore be ſure of this, when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſuffers his Son, or any thing that belongs to him to come to theſe low conditions, when <hi>truth failes in the ſtreet, and equity is perverted;</hi> it is not that <hi>God</hi> means to ſuffer the wicked to have their wills, for <hi>God</hi> hath ſworn that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall reign, but to <hi>trie us</hi> a little ſpace, whether we will couragiouſly <hi>ſtick to God</hi> and his <hi>cauſe,</hi> or baſely for fear of men comply with the world. <note place="margin">3. For the compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the it enemies.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is a third reaſon; <hi>God</hi> (as it were) <hi>keeps ſilence;</hi> and <hi>holds his peace</hi> in the middſt of the greateſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117675:48"/> troubles to this end, that God may (as it were) <hi>gather the wicked into one fagot, into one bundle that they may be deſtroyed together.</hi> There is a great deal of ado to <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Saints</hi> in this world; and truly there is ſome ado <hi>togather the wicked.</hi> So God withdraws himſelf from his people, yet he hath a <hi>hook</hi> in their hearts, he holds them up <hi>ſecretly</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> that they ſhall not <hi>leave</hi> him; yet the world ſhall not ſee but that God hath quite <hi>left</hi> them, and all their <hi>Ordinances</hi> and his <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and every thing: and then the wicked <hi>come together</hi> and inſult, whereby <hi>God</hi> may come upon them <hi>at once,</hi> and deſtroy them, as we finde ten <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in this <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Geneſis, God ſtirs</hi> up the <hi>Nations</hi> againſt <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his poſterity, and there are ten <hi>Nations</hi> that <hi>God</hi> promiſeth to cut off before <hi>Abraham</hi> at once, the <hi>Perrezites,</hi> and the <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>God heaps them together,</hi> and burns them like ſtubble. Thoſe that burn ſtubble have <hi>rakes,</hi> and they gather it to <hi>heaps,</hi> and then they fire it. This is the way of <hi>Gods keeping ſilence</hi> among his people, and <hi>ſitting ſtill</hi> in the midſt of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, thus <hi>God gathers</hi> their enemies on <hi>heaps</hi> as ſtubble, that he may burn them together.</p>
            <p>Therefore from this that I have ſaid, I have three words to ſay to you, and to my own ſoul.</p>

            </p>
            <p>They are called <hi>hidden ones,</hi> or <hi>ſecret ones</hi> (as ſome read it) becauſe they are <hi>precious:</hi> as in <hi>Exodus</hi> God <note place="margin">The Saints Gods hidden ones.</note> calls them his <hi>treaſure,</hi> my <hi>peculiar people,</hi> my <hi>treaſure.</hi> And you know our treaſure and riches, we <hi>hide</hi> it, and keep it <hi>ſecret.</hi>

            <p>They are called <hi>hidden ones</hi> (I think) principally, becauſe the <hi>world</hi> knowes them not; becauſe the Devill alway hath ſome <hi>vail</hi> upon the eyes of the wicked, that they are not able to <hi>know</hi> the Saints <hi>as Saints.</hi> 1 Ioh. 3. <hi>Now we are the ſons of God, and the world knowes us not.</hi> It is the cleareſt note of a man truly carnall, that hath nothing of <hi>God</hi> in him, he will tell you that he knows not who are <hi>Gods</hi> children and Saints, and who are not, the Devill hath ſo many wayes, and <hi>nick-names;</hi> as to call them <hi>Lollards,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Puritans,</hi> and now there are more <hi>nick-names</hi> then ever. So God hath his Saints, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are his <hi>treaſure,</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> ones, but he <hi>hides</hi> them from the world: for it is not in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of wicked men to perſecute the Saints <hi>as Saints,</hi> but they perſecute them as <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> or <hi>hereticks</hi> one way or other; yet it may be they may be Gods <hi>hidden</hi> ones. Therefore what you do againſt Gods hidden ones, you do againſt him. I beſeech you take heed how you <hi>conſult,</hi> and <hi>conſpire</hi> againſt people that

            <p>Therefore I beſeech you take this caveat from the <hi>Lord,</hi> that you would take heed how you carry your ſelves againſt the Saints, though they be but ſome <hi>few particular perſons;</hi> though it may be there may be ſome <hi>weakneſs</hi> in them that may provoke your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: for if you once begin to fall on perſecuting, to oppoſe <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> or his people, though you begin with a few, firſt one, and then another, you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares fall into the <hi>tide,</hi> into the <hi>ſtreame;</hi> to ſet on the <hi>whole deſigne</hi> of the Devill, that is, to cut <hi>off the people of God from being a Nation, that the name of Iſrael may be no more remembred.</hi> It is an eaſie thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>ſtreame</hi> of perſecution. There is no man that ſets himſelf againſt the whole Generation of Saints <hi>at once;</hi> but firſt he quarrells with <hi>this</hi> profeſſor, and then with that; and it may be there is a reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>this,</hi> and pretended reaſon to diſlike the wayes of <hi>that,</hi> till at laſt he come to be an <hi>abſolute</hi> perſecuter of <hi>all godlineſſe.</hi>

            <p> The prophet tells the <hi>Lord</hi> what the <hi>deſigne</hi> is, and then doth preſs God forward; in <hi>verſe</hi> 5. he tells him of their <hi>conſultation</hi> again: he had ſpoken it three times before, and here again. <hi>They have conſulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with one conſent, they are confederate againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prophet would have God <hi>hearken</hi> to him, and <hi>take notice</hi> of his complaint from two arguments.</p>
            <p>The one is from the <hi>depth</hi> of their conſpiracies, and their <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> conſultation.</p>
            <p>And the other was, becauſe whatſoever they did againſt his <hi>hidden ones,</hi> he tells God it was againſt <hi>him.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">God perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the Saints.</note> So that <hi>(beloved)</hi> it is a great argument with God to <hi>awaken</hi> and <hi>ſtir him up</hi> againſt the wicked, and to <hi>help</hi> his people; when the wicked <hi>conſult,</hi> and <hi>plot</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a ſore thing when men <hi>occaſionally</hi> and <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally,</hi> and <hi>Ignorantly</hi> fall into the ſtreame of the wicked, to do things againſt the <hi>Saints:</hi> but it is more grievous when they <hi>conſult,</hi> and are <hi>confederate,</hi> and <hi>aſſociat</hi> themſelves together, and beat their heads, and brains together, and lay ſnare upon ſnare, and deſigne upon deſigne, againſt the hidden ones of God.</p>
            <p>Know beloved, and be ſure that there is no <hi>conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> ſo ſecret but God knowes it; there is nothing ſo hidden, but it is <hi>open to the backbone</hi> before him, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. It is a thing of jealouſie that God will not ſuffer, when people <hi>conſult</hi> together againſt God and his people. It is enough, and too much that oft times <hi>ignorantly,</hi> and <hi>raſhly</hi> we ſpeak and do againſt the Saints (as a man out of <hi>frailty</hi> may do) but if we go to <hi>conſult</hi> once, there are thouſands of Saints that will <hi>awaken God,</hi> and wiſh God to come to the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117675:52"/> Therefore whatſoever we do of ignorance, God may <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>pity:</hi> but <hi>take heed</hi> of all <hi>conſpiring,</hi> and <hi>conſulting</hi> againſt the <hi>Saints.</hi> And remember that I warne you this day, that if you hear that there is any <hi>meeting</hi> againſt the <hi>Saints,</hi> that there is a <hi>deſigne</hi> going on to root them out in this, or that <hi>notion:</hi> for I love not thoſe <hi>names,</hi> nor <hi>plead</hi> for this or that way, but when it is againſt the <hi>Saints,</hi> as a <hi>blind</hi> man may <hi>ſee</hi> in ſuch <hi>wayes</hi> as the world <hi>uſeth.</hi> I beſeech you that come here to <hi>hear God,</hi> Take <hi>warning;</hi> have nothing to do with their <hi>conſpiracies</hi> and <hi>plottings:</hi> for <hi>God</hi> will not brook that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are confederate againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an old common truth, commonly known to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and to the <hi>world too;</hi> whatſoever you do againſt the <hi>Saints,</hi> you do againſt <hi>God, he that toucheth you</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>toucheth the apple of mine eye. In all their afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> and (ſaith the <hi>Lord Chriſt) the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me;</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe. And that known place <hi>Acts</hi> 9. when <hi>Paul</hi> was going on a <hi>deſigne</hi> to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to perſecute the Saints, <hi>the Lord Chriſt met him by the way;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> He doth not ſay, why doſt thou go to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and arm wicked people to deſtroy my <hi>children?</hi> He ſpeaks not ſuch a word: but he ſaith; Thou perſecuteſt <hi>me.</hi> For the poor <hi>Saints</hi> they are <hi>under covert,</hi> they are <hi>married</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and we cannot <hi>defend</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> but we are <hi>married</hi> to one that will <hi>defend</hi> our <hi>ſuit,</hi> and what is done, he takes it as done to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and will accordingly judge them that do it.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever good you do to the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:117675:52"/> takes it as done to <hi>him;</hi> and whatſoever <hi>evill</hi> you do to the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> takes it as done to <hi>him; Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>When I was hungry you fed me, when I was naked ye cloathed me, when I was in priſon you viſited me, And they ſhall ſay, Lord, when did we ſee thee hungry, or naked, or in priſon? In as much as you did it to one of theſe little ones, you did it to me.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Saints, God,</hi> and the people of God are <hi>one.</hi> We are too ſubject to forget <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>members;</hi> we think not that we <hi>offend Chriſt,</hi> when out of imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or out of heat or the like, we offend a <hi>poor Saint:</hi> and we think not that we help <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly when we help a <hi>poor Saint,</hi> if we did, we would be more wary in the one, and more ready and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the other.</p>
            <p>The prophet having entred his <hi>ſuit,</hi> and <hi>complaint</hi> in generall, he comes to <hi>particulars,</hi> and tells God who they are that had done this. God might ſay, Who are theſe that <hi>conſpire</hi> againſt me, and againſt my people, and hidden ones? Lord (ſaith the prophet) I will tell thee who they are.</p>
            <p>

            <p>He names ſome ten <hi>Nations,</hi> that joyned together againſt <hi>one poor Iſrael.</hi> It is a thing you ſhould obſerve that when the people of God are <hi>conſpired</hi> againſt, God reſts not in <hi>generall complaints,</hi> but he will <hi>know</hi> who they are.

            <p>But let us a little view theſe <hi>Nations</hi> that were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; they were very <hi>numerous,</hi> very many.

            <p>Beloved, they of all others the <hi>Lord</hi> takes <hi>notice</hi> of in <hi>conſpiring againſt the Saints,</hi> who have received <hi>kindneſs</hi> from the Saints.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>O my God</hi> (ſaith the prophet) <hi>make them like a wheele.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And make them as the ſtubble before the wind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And make them as the fire that burneth the wood, and as the flame that ſetteth the mountains on fire, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>O my God, make them as a wheele.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Some conceive, the meaning is, <hi>make them as a wheele going down a hill,</hi> that give it but <hi>half a turne,</hi> and every motion will add ſtrength to its courſe, the longer it runs down, the <hi>ſtronger;</hi> ſo the <hi>meaning is,</hi> let their own <hi>deviſes;</hi> and <hi>deſignes,</hi> tumble them <hi>further</hi> and <hi>further</hi> into <hi>miſery;</hi> let every thing they do, help to <hi>throw them down to hell.</hi> That is true: but I rather follow the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word that ſignifies any <hi>round, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,</hi> or <hi>light</hi> thing: for all do not read it <hi>as a wheel.</hi> So the meaning is, <hi>O my God, let them never ſolidly be able to conclude any thing,</hi> but let them be ſo unſtable that they may <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>undo,</hi> and <hi>ſay,</hi> and <hi>unſay;</hi> let them not proſper in <hi>any thing,</hi> but do thou <hi>daſh</hi> all that they do, let it be as a <hi>feather</hi> or a light thing; toſſed <hi>up and</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:117675:56"/> 
               <hi>down</hi> in the <hi>aire.</hi> That is a thing that we ſee <hi>God</hi> many times doth, he makes the counſells of the wicked though they have wiſe heads, learned heads, and number enough, yet all produce but a <hi>feather,</hi> and all <hi>vapours</hi> into aire.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Let them be as ſtubble before the wind.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>That makes me think that the word <hi>wheele</hi> is ſo to be underſtood becauſe of <hi>this</hi> expreſſion: he doth not ſay, Make them as <hi>ſtubble before the fire</hi> (though that be true, and it is ſo expreſt in another place) but as <hi>ſtubble before the wind.</hi> And all do not read it <hi>ſtubble,</hi> but conceive it many be meant <hi>chaffe</hi> or any <hi>light</hi> thing. I adhere to theſe rather; and ſo it comes to the ſame thing, Make them, and all their <hi>deſignes,</hi> and plots <hi>as chaffe before the wind;</hi> let them not go on in a <hi>ſteady</hi> reſolution, and courſe; but <hi>daſh</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi> all their projects and policies, and bring them to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the fire that burneth the wood, and as the flame that ſetteth the mountains on fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is terrible: the meaning of it is, as we ſee in the verſe following; <hi>Lord,</hi> let thy <hi>tempeſt</hi> and <hi>ſtorm</hi> make them <hi>afraid:</hi> Let thy <hi>judgement</hi> come on them and devour them, as the fire doth <hi>Goſs,</hi> or <hi>Heath,</hi> or <hi>Fearne,</hi> or <hi>furrs,</hi> that one would think a whole <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> were burning when a childe doth but ſet fire on <hi>Fures;</hi> ſo let thoſe terrible <hi>judgements</hi> and ſtorms of thine take them. And whereto? <note place="margin">Two ends of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the wicked. 1. To work ſhame in them.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are two ends for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>that it may fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy name.</hi> There are no people ſo wickedly, and miſchievouſly bent againſt the Saints, that they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117675:57"/> ſhould deſire God to <hi>ruine,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy them;</hi> onely, they may <hi>deſire God</hi> to ſend <hi>his tempeſt,</hi> and <hi>ſtorme</hi> on them, that they may <hi>learn to be afraid,</hi> and <hi>ſeek the name of the Lord.</hi> As <hi>Steven,</hi> when <hi>Saul,</hi> and the reſt ſtoned him, ſaith he, <hi>Lord lay it not to their charge.</hi> There is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> more improper and unbecoming a <hi>Saint,</hi> then <hi>revenge;</hi> and a Saint that hath been a ſlave, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and kept from the <hi>pit</hi> by the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> he ſhould not deſire the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of any creature; he hath had <hi>mercy</hi> by the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> therefore he ſhould have <hi>mercy</hi> on every <hi>creature.</hi> And <hi>truly</hi> a <hi>man that</hi> knows his own <hi>deſert,</hi> and his <hi>nature,</hi> and his <hi>wayes,</hi> and knows how much <hi>grace and mercy</hi> God ſhewes to <hi>his</hi> ſoul, he ſhould not deſire <hi>the worſt man to go to hell, and periſh.</hi> Therefore take heed leaſt there be any <hi>ſpirit of revenge</hi> in any of <hi>Gods</hi> people, though the wicked <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire</hi> never ſo much: but deſire that the Lord would make all <hi>ſtubble that they do,</hi> as a <hi>wheele,</hi> as a <hi>vain</hi> thing; or if he will ſend a <hi>little fire of affliction</hi> upon them, to make <hi>them ſeek his face;</hi> this is <hi>the utmoſt we ſhould deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if God will not do this, that they may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That men may know that thou, whoſe name alone is Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, art the moſt high, over all the earth.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 To work amendment in others.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Some underſtand it, as though it were <hi>meant</hi> of the <hi>ſame people;</hi> for the <hi>word Men</hi> is not in the originall; <hi>that they may know that thou, whoſe name is Iehovah.</hi> But that is not allowed, and approved by the <hi>generality:</hi> but they take it in generall, and the originall will bear it better; that the <hi>name of Iehovah may be known,</hi> though they <hi>will not</hi> know it: it may be God may
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:117675:57"/> 
               <hi>blaſt</hi> their counſells, and they will be at it <hi>again;</hi> and God may <hi>caſt fire</hi> among them, and they will not be <hi>aſhamed:</hi> yet others will, they will take notice how <hi>wicked</hi> people conſpired againſt the <hi>people of God</hi> at ſuch a time and in ſuch a place, and God made it as a <hi>bubble,</hi> and plagued, and puniſhed them, and ſent the Peſtilence into their Cities, and families; <hi>they</hi> will not learn; but there are <hi>other</hi> people that will <hi>worſhip Iehovah,</hi> that will <hi>fear</hi> the Lord by ſeeing his <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on others. As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>When the wicked are taken away as droſſe, my fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, I am afraid of thy judgements.</hi> When he ſaw the wicked <hi>took away as droſſe,</hi> with the <hi>fire</hi> of Gods judgements, he feared. Therefore learn not to deſire their <hi>death,</hi> onely to <hi>pray</hi> for them, and to believe that all their <hi>plottings</hi> againſt the Saints will be as <hi>ſtubble,</hi> and as chaff, they will come to nothing. And if the wicked will not learn by ſeeing God <hi>to croſſe</hi> them; as he hath <hi>croſſed</hi> all their deſignes in our age (bleſſed be his name) yet do thou take notice how God <hi>went againſt</hi> ſuch people, and ſuch a Nation that roſe againſt God; God <hi>croſt,</hi> and <hi>blaſted</hi> them: and be ſure that God will do ſo to the end, to all that riſe againſt him and his people. Only take notice of Gods ways in the world, to <hi>fear</hi> him, and <hi>truſt</hi> in him, and to <hi>wait</hi> for him to come and do what thy ſoul deſireth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Promiſed if <hi>the Lord would give me ſtrength,</hi> to ſpeak a word unto you this afternoone, concerning the <hi>mercies of God</hi> unto us in the <hi>victories of Scotland,</hi> but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> becauſe we have <hi>more knowledg</hi> of it, and more <hi>relation to it,</hi> the moſt of us. And therefore I would briefly from this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> take occaſion or ground of what I have to <hi>ſpeak</hi> to you. Two things briefly I ſee here laid down in this <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth expreſſe the <hi>great mercie of God</hi> to him, in ſome <hi>ſpeciall deliverance.</hi> And that he doth illuſtrate by the <hi>miſery he was in:</hi> for he was in <hi>a very low condition,</hi> full of <hi>tears,</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:117675:58"/> and <hi>ſorrows,</hi> and his <hi>feet</hi> were <hi>ready to fall,</hi> ſo the <hi>Lord heard his prayer,</hi> and <hi>delivered him out of his troubles,</hi> whatſoever they were. That is one thing, he takes notice of the <hi>great mercie of God</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, he doth conſider, <hi>what he ſhould do to God:</hi> now God having <hi>delivered him,</hi> what is his duty? For it is a <hi>known leſson</hi> among us, that the <hi>mercies</hi> of God <hi>require ſomewhat from us</hi> (though all be by his <hi>grace)</hi> And thoſe are here laid down in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> they are <hi>various, I will love the Lord, I will call upon him while I live, I will walk before him in the land of the living,</hi> and diverſe ſuch <hi>duties</hi> he lays <hi>upon</hi> himſelf in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods <hi>great mercy to him.</hi> Now I have not <hi>time</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to go over all, which are many in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and therefore I will onely tell you a few <hi>thoughts</hi> that I have concerning <hi>Gods mercie</hi> in <hi>beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Briſtoll</hi> upon us again, and that according to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> method here, which is the moſt naturall, and the moſt uſuall by the Saints.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to take notice of <hi>Gods goodneſs in that mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly to conſider <hi>what is our duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, there are abundance of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>kindneſſes, couched,</hi> and <hi>wrapped</hi> up together in that. It was <hi>not only</hi> the taking of a Garriſon, but there are <hi>abundance of mercies</hi> in it, and <hi>mingled</hi> with it, you <note place="margin">Gods mercy in the taking in of Briſtoll conſidered in five re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. 1. In regard of the potent oppoſition.</note> eſpecially that are <hi>concerned</hi> in it, and are <hi>godly,</hi> you know: but in my eye theſe are the <hi>chiefe</hi> that I ſee, and am <hi>affected</hi> with.</p>
            <p>The firſt is. I look upon the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of the <hi>mercie,</hi> I ſee that all were <hi>great things in,</hi> and <hi>about it,</hi> there was no <hi>meane, inconſiderable</hi> thing in it. I know it is a <hi>great City,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> in the Kingdom; and I know
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117675:59"/> alſo, there were <hi>great works</hi> to keep it, I know there were <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>numerous</hi> ſouldiers in it. There were <hi>great reſolutions</hi> in thoſe ſouldiers, And I am ſure too, there was <hi>great miſerie</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> among the <hi>poor</hi> people, and <hi>round about</hi> the City, &amp; hath been theſe <hi>two yeers,</hi> the <hi>plague, ſcarſity</hi> of proviſion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. And no man doubts but it is of great <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,</hi> if the <hi>Lord</hi> make it a <hi>bleſſing</hi> to us, if the <hi>Lord ſanctifie</hi> it, it will be of <hi>great conſequence,</hi> not only to <hi>thoſe</hi> parts (being the <hi>chiefe City</hi> in that part of the Kingdom) but to <hi>this City</hi> and to the <hi>whole State,</hi> and Kingdom, I ſee nothing in it but great things.</p>
            <p>And therefore me thinks that he that ſhould do <hi>this</hi> for us, ſurely he muſt needs be a <hi>great God,</hi> that <hi>pulled down</hi> the <hi>great pride of that City,</hi> and the <hi>gariſon</hi> in it, that muſt <hi>throw</hi> down thoſe <hi>Bulwarks</hi> (as it were) And therefore, let us <hi>exalt God,</hi> let us conceive of <hi>God</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>greatneſſe:</hi> for ſurely, he that did that work there, no man will <hi>doubt,</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> that it was <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> that did it, any man that will <hi>ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</hi> of the work, will ſay <hi>he</hi> is a <hi>great God:</hi> therefore let us glorifie <hi>him</hi> in <hi>his</hi> greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>Another thing very <hi>obſervable</hi> that we ſhould take <note place="margin">2. In regard of the hazard in ſtorming.</note> 
               <hi>notice</hi> of, is, that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath there preſerved our <hi>friends,</hi> preſerved our <hi>Army</hi> in ſuch a <hi>wonderfull</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>ſtorming</hi> that <hi>City.</hi> I have no skill in war, but I think there are no people that go about <hi>ſtorming,</hi> but they reſolve to <hi>loſe many a man,</hi> therefore they will do any thing rather then ſtorme, if it may be <hi>gotten</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and to <hi>ſtorme</hi> ſuch a <hi>City,</hi> ſuch <hi>Forts,</hi> ſuch <hi>ſtrength,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Caſtle, double lined</hi> in ſome parts, and to do it by <hi>no very great Army</hi> neither, and that the <hi>Lord</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:117675:59"/> ſhould pleaſe to <hi>preſerve</hi> them, that ſo few ſhould be ſlaine or wounded, it is a <hi>wonderfull mercy.</hi> For truly (beloved) when there were but a <hi>few</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> when the <hi>other ſide</hi> ſought it, they had it not ſo <hi>cheap,</hi> it coſt them the <hi>lives of many hundreds</hi> of them: but this was the <hi>Lords goodneſſe</hi> to his <hi>poor people,</hi> and truly we may ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth here, <hi>he hath inclined his ear to us, and heard our prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then a third <hi>bleſſing,</hi> that I take <hi>notice</hi> of in it, is, <note place="margin">3. In preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it from the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> that <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>preſerve our friends from the peſtilence.</hi> We alway <hi>conceived</hi> that if they had that <hi>City,</hi> they knew not what to <hi>do</hi> with it, becauſe of the <hi>peſtilence,</hi> that might <hi>ruine,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Army after they had took it: and as we hear, though they be in the ſame <hi>houſes,</hi> and <hi>quarter</hi> where the <hi>ſickneſſe</hi> was, and have lain in the <hi>beds</hi> where men have <hi>been ſick,</hi> yet we hear little or nothing of the <hi>infection</hi> coming among <hi>them.</hi> Surely, this can be no other but the <hi>finger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how <hi>hot,</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> it was.</p>
            <p>Then I <hi>look</hi> upon it <hi>further,</hi> as to conſider what <note place="margin">4. In that this ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſeries of mercies.</note> 
               <hi>mercies there had gone in a ſtreight line before,</hi> and how this comes <hi>after, mercy</hi> upon <hi>mercy, God</hi> adding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>greater</hi> to the <hi>leſſe.</hi> This hath not been Gods way with us <hi>hitherto,</hi> but if <hi>God heard</hi> us in <hi>one mercy, he</hi> gave us a <hi>correction</hi> preſently, if we did get <hi>one gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> we loſt <hi>another,</hi> if we have <hi>one victory,</hi> we loſe <hi>another.</hi> Now that <hi>God,</hi> that is a <hi>Zealous God,</hi> ſhould go on, and not <hi>ſee iniquity</hi> in <hi>his</hi> people, and <hi>paſſe by</hi> their <hi>infirmities,</hi> and ſhould go from <hi>on Fort</hi> to another, and from <hi>one garriſon</hi> to another, and bring in this great <hi>City</hi> to the <hi>reſt.</hi> I ſpeak of it, becauſe the <hi>chief</hi> thing in this <hi>City</hi> is to deſire to ſee the <hi>glory</hi> of God as <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:117675:60"/> did, to deſire above all things to ſee <hi>God, perfect God.</hi> We know <hi>God</hi> is <hi>perfect,</hi> and uſeth not to <hi>work by halves:</hi> but <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>hidden</hi> that attribute in a <hi>great meaſure</hi> among us. He gave us many <hi>overtures of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> but he called for them <hi>back again,</hi> and ſo preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned our <hi>joy,</hi> into <hi>ſorrow.</hi> It hath been <hi>familiar</hi> in all his <hi>diſpenſations</hi> to us, for theſe two, or three yeers; Now that the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould go on from <hi>one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> without <hi>interruption,</hi> and caſt nothing in by the way to <hi>imbitter</hi> our mercies, and to go from <hi>leſſe to greater</hi> in this manner, me thinks the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a <hi>perfect God,</hi> as he did to our <hi>fathers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that is a <hi>glorious</hi> attribute.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is not a <hi>little mercie</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <note place="margin">5.

            <p>And truly if you will give me leave to tell you what I think (for we may haply <hi>judge</hi> of Gods mercie in this, becauſe of our <hi>concernment</hi> further then ſome of you) it is a <hi>great mercie in our apprehenſion,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath cleared his people that came thence. For when they came up, I remember well, of all people that came from any part of the Kingdom, as I apprehend (pardon me if I miſapprehend) the <hi>Briſtoll people,</hi> and thoſe parts (though they received much <hi>kindneſſe</hi> from this <hi>City,</hi> which they are bound with <hi>thankfulneſſe ever to acknowledg,</hi> yet) they lay under a <hi>blurr,</hi> becauſe they were looked on as <hi>faulty,</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> and <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,</hi> that they <hi>loſt</hi> the <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>endangered</hi> the Kingdom. That truly beſides their <hi>loſſes,</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> that you cannot <hi>imagine</hi> unleſſe you had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:117675:60"/> ſuffered with them) this was not a <hi>ſmall affliction,</hi> to ſee ſo many <hi>frown</hi> on them, and to add <hi>affliction</hi> to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> as though if they had been <hi>more valiant,</hi> and <hi>couragious,</hi> they might have <hi>kept</hi> the City, and have <hi>ſaved</hi> it, &amp;c. I meddle not with the <hi>commanders,</hi> and <hi>governours;</hi> but I ſpeak of you that are here, and the <hi>good people of Briſtoll</hi> that uſe to be here: I ſay the <hi>Lord</hi> hath reſtored the <hi>poor people,</hi> to their <hi>home</hi> at leaſt (though that be <hi>naked</hi> enough for them) and hath taken away their <hi>reproach,</hi> for though we ſaid before, that we did what we <hi>could</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> the <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>ſtood out,</hi> yet it was <hi>generally</hi> thought, that we might have done more: but now it appears to the <hi>world,</hi> that now there were many more then we had, at leaſt three for one, and there were two yeers <hi>works, forts,</hi> and <hi>lines</hi> built more then there was then, and we kept them out three dayes in ſtorming, and I hear not that they did one. As ſoon as we <hi>loſt</hi> the City we <hi>capitulated,</hi> ſo did they as ſoon as they loſt it. I ſay not but that we had <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> and (it may be) from the <hi>greateſt</hi> to the <hi>leaſt</hi> wanted <hi>skill</hi> in mannaging it: but I know (and I ſhould know as much as one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> were valiant from the leaſt to the greateſt. The <hi>Lord</hi> hath taken away the <hi>reproach:</hi> for whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> were <hi>pitied,</hi> many <hi>frowned</hi> upon <hi>Briſtoll</hi> men after all their <hi>ſufferings.</hi> There are many other things that are not now <hi>expedient</hi> to inſiſt upon. I leave it to your ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>And what the goodneſſe of <hi>God</hi> is to us in the <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Scotland,</hi> no man (though we know it but in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall)</hi> can be <hi>ignorant,</hi> how that <hi>Kingdom</hi> being <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the enemy</hi> would have been over us, and all the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:117675:61"/> three <hi>Kingdoms</hi> would have been <hi>gone</hi> in the eye of reaſon: but <hi>God</hi> hath ſent them <hi>ſeaſonable reliefe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectation: <hi>A great mercie!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from all this, I will tell you <hi>my thoughts,</hi> what you, and I ſhould <hi>learn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, for ever hereafter we ſhould learn <hi>patiently to wait upon the Lord,</hi> when we have made our <hi>prayers</hi> to him, and he hath made his <hi>promiſes</hi> to us. We had many promiſes <hi>in our eye,</hi> and we made our <hi>prayers,</hi> but when the <hi>Lord</hi> gave the <hi>City</hi> into their hands, we thought the <hi>promiſes,</hi> and our <hi>prayers</hi> were <hi>loſt;</hi> neither <hi>did</hi> we ſee, or <hi>could</hi> underſtand, how any thing ſhould become of them but onely <hi>ſhame,</hi> and <hi>reproach.</hi> For we boaſted of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and in the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and at our <hi>work,</hi> that the <hi>Lord was our God,</hi> and <hi>would help us,</hi> and yet the Lord <hi>turned</hi> it <hi>againſt us,</hi> and there were <hi>few</hi> of us that had ſo much <hi>grace</hi> as to <hi>wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</hi> on him, and to know that though nothing <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared</hi> the <hi>viſion would ſpeak and would not lie.</hi> But now we are <hi>convinced</hi> of our folly, and we ſee that God hath <hi>fully anſwered thoſe prayers of Briſtoll.</hi> For thoſe <hi>prayers</hi> I believe did ſpeak <hi>loudeſt,</hi> of all the <hi>prayers</hi> in England, in <hi>getting</hi> that <hi>City,</hi> And I <hi>value</hi> one of thoſe <hi>prayers</hi> more then an <hi>hundred</hi> now, for they are old <hi>prayers in ſtore, ſtale prayers are good.</hi> And they were <hi>prayers</hi> from <hi>broken, afflicted ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>believing hearts.</hi> And now you ſee how the <hi>Lord</hi> hath graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>raiment</hi> for <hi>his people,</hi> and done the <hi>ſouls</hi> of many of them <hi>much good,</hi> and in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſtored their <hi>dwellings,</hi> and <hi>habitations</hi> to them. Therefore there is a word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. that I did think to open. The Apoſtle there comparing the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:117675:61"/> together, he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> is thus deſcribed by <hi>Moſes, The man that doth theſe things, ſhall live in them.</hi> That is the language of the <hi>law, he that doth theſe things,</hi> he that <hi>keeps the law</hi> ſhall be ſaved. But the <hi>righteouſneſſe of faith</hi> (the way of <hi>faith,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. or the way of the <hi>Goſpell) ſpeaketh on this wiſe,</hi> it hath <hi>another</hi> kinde of language, <hi>ſay not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, the word of faith which we Preach.</hi> That is, this is the <hi>language of faith,</hi> that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſſe</hi> for us. And how do we come to know this? Here is the <hi>word,</hi> and then the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>faith;</hi> this is the <hi>language;</hi> this is the way of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the way of <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, What is that word of Faith that this is grounded on?</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle chooſeth <hi>one Scripture,</hi> verſe 11. in ſtead of all other as there are <hi>abundance</hi> of Scriptures ſetting forth the <hi>Goſpell way:</hi> but he takes this as <hi>one</hi> of the chief among the reſt) <hi>whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> He takes it out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28. <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> He takes (I ſay) that as one of the <hi>chief</hi> Scriptures of <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that is to be the foundation of the <hi>way of faith:</hi> and though you may apply it for the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> ſo; yet you may for <hi>every thing</hi> elſe, that this is a <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>ſure</hi> rule, he <hi>that believeth on God ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> So the Lord hath removed our <hi>reproach.</hi> We heard with our ears <hi>jeering</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Preachers,</hi> and <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but now <hi>bleſſed le God</hi> we need not bluſh, we may <hi>own our prayers,</hi> and <hi>ſtand</hi> to our <hi>preaching,</hi> and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117675:62"/> 
               <hi>glory</hi> in the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God: <hi>he that believeth ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, hereafter, though God doth <hi>delay</hi> a long while, (as this was about <hi>two years,</hi> and a monety) yet notwithſtanding learn to <hi>believe</hi> in God ſtill, <hi>wait</hi> upon God <hi>patiently,</hi> and either the whole <hi>Goſpell</hi> will not hold, or elſe <hi>this</hi> will: for this is the <hi>pillar</hi> of it; <hi>he that believeth ſhall not be aſhamed. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient abiding of the meeke ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> If God ſee a man <hi>meekly,</hi> and <hi>patiently</hi> wait for <hi>him,</hi> his <hi>waiting</hi> ſhall not be in vain, and though it be <hi>long</hi> in our eyes, yet a <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> with <hi>God</hi> are as <hi>one</hi> day, and <hi>one</hi> day as a <hi>thouſand yeers.</hi> And the delay of a <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> is as it were but <hi>a day,</hi> yet he brings about all <hi>his promiſes of mercies ſweetly</hi> for <hi>his glory,</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, whatſoever we would have for <hi>his glory,</hi> and the <hi>good of his people,</hi> let us <hi>follow</hi> God, and <hi>reſt</hi> on his word. Remember that <hi>Goſpell</hi> pillar (I ſay not promiſe, but pillar) <hi>he that believeth ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> That is one thing.</p>
            <p>Another is this, that we ſhould (but God knows <hi>when</hi> we will <hi>learn</hi> it: for people are further, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>learning</hi> it every day) me thinks learn <hi>hence</hi> a little in due order and manner to <hi>honour the Saints, and people of God.</hi> A man would think ſo: but blinde men cannot ſee. We know that there is an <hi>Army,</hi> the generality (I hope I may ſay ſo of them) being <hi>godly</hi> people: an <hi>Army</hi> (I think truly, I may ſay without diſparagement to any other <hi>fearing God,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking his honour,</hi> as much as any <hi>Army</hi> under the cope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven theſe five hundred yeers. Bleſſed be <hi>God</hi> that put it in your <hi>hearts</hi> to <hi>reform</hi> them, if there be <hi>any evill</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:117675:62"/> among them, it is one of the moſt <hi>glorious works that ever</hi> you did. Now it is no <hi>diſparagement</hi> to God, that <hi>under God,</hi> and <hi>in God</hi> we honour his <hi>people.</hi> Therefore wo to them that call <hi>light</hi> darkneſſe, of which to this day the ſtreets are full all the week long, notwithſtanding the <hi>humility,</hi> the <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> and all the <hi>graces</hi> that are to be ſeen as <hi>cleare</hi> as the ſun in the firmament in this <hi>Army,</hi> yet you ſhall have <hi>people,</hi> and many that would be called <hi>profeſſors</hi> to <hi>reproach</hi> them, and raile, and ſay, <note place="margin">A ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Army, that when they had got the power they intended to rule both King and Parliament. The admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able graces obſerved in the Army by the Author long ſince.</note> they fight for their <hi>own ends,</hi> they <hi>ſeek themſelves,</hi> they are <hi>no friends to the Parliament;</hi> they meane to get a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>power,</hi> and then to rule <hi>King, and Parliament</hi> too. O <hi>blaſphemous ſpeeches!</hi> Beloved, for my part, I have not been there <hi>oft,</hi> but I ſaw more <hi>grace,</hi> in that <hi>ſmall</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (poor wretches) then in all the Kingdom beſides.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſee more <hi>love</hi> there, <hi>their</hi> love is <hi>true</hi> love, and it is love to one another <hi>as they are Saints, as they are honeſt men;</hi> and not as ſuch a one <hi>holds a faction</hi> this way, or that way. If one man be wounded, they will all venture their lives to <hi>fetch him off;</hi> and if one <hi>be ſick,</hi> every one <hi>contributes</hi> to his wants; there is abundance of <hi>ſweet love:</hi> There is <hi>unity:</hi> here is <hi>biting,</hi> ſuch a one is a <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> another is an <hi>Independent,</hi> another is an <hi>Anabaptiſt:</hi> there is no ſuch <hi>biting</hi> there: They look not in <hi>mens mouthes,</hi> as men do in <hi>horſes</hi> mouthes, and ſay is he a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?</hi> but is he an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, a <hi>godly</hi> man? if he be, he is a <hi>companion</hi> for any <hi>godly</hi> man.</p>
            <p>We are the moſt <hi>miſerable men</hi> in the world, this <hi>poor</hi> City: if a man had as much <hi>grace</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> had, if ſome <hi>Independent</hi> ſee him, and ſay he is <hi>inclining</hi> to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:117675:63"/> 
               <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or if a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſee him, and ſay, he is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining</hi> to <hi>Independencie,</hi> then <hi>let him go,</hi> and <hi>cut his throat.</hi> The Lord pity you, that ſo <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> in the <hi>ſouls</hi> of people may be the <hi>object</hi> of your love. Is there <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> there? be there what there will if there be not that, I have nothing to do. Now if one that is <hi>carnall</hi> joyn with me, or <hi>another,</hi> or a third man in <hi>faction,</hi> we take him. The <hi>Lord</hi> pity us; it is not ſo in the <hi>Army,</hi> It would do you good to go among them twenty four hours to ſee the <hi>unity</hi> that is among them. I ſay, learn to <hi>honour</hi> the Saints.</p>
            <p>Then there is a <hi>ſpirituality</hi> there, there is a thing that may be called <hi>ſpirituality</hi> in the Army. There is not onely a <hi>profeſsion,</hi> and <hi>duties,</hi> &amp;c. as we have here, but a kind of <hi>flower of godlineſse,</hi> ſome ſparklings of their <hi>graces;</hi> there is not onely <hi>grace,</hi> but grace <hi>flying.</hi> As when I was in the <hi>Army,</hi> I ſaw ſome <hi>glory</hi> ſhine in their <hi>graces,</hi> that would <hi>dazle a mans eyes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as the <hi>Sun,</hi> an <hi>excellencie of grace,</hi> the <hi>ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grace.</hi> We ſtrive about low, <hi>carnall things,</hi> about this and that, but they, about the <hi>myſteries</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, you may ſee it gloriouſly.</p>
            <p>And then what <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> is there! Who lives there by <hi>plundering,</hi> and <hi>ſtealing,</hi> as many have done; and do? And then, when <hi>honour</hi> is got, how doth every one ſtudy to caſt honour on his <hi>brother,</hi> and not on <hi>himſelf!</hi> and ſtudies <hi>ſilence</hi> not to have his name <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi> but that <hi>God</hi> may have glory, O it is a <hi>glorious</hi> thing.</p>
            <p>And then what <hi>fidelity!</hi> If there were nothing in them of all thoſe things in that <hi>flaming</hi> manner, yet
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:117675:63"/> me thinks their fidelity as <hi>ſubjects</hi> ſhould make them honourable,</p>
            <p>How?</p>
            <p>I will tell you how; becauſe that having <hi>no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment</hi> almoſt, but <hi>railing,</hi> and <hi>ſcoffing,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning</hi> of them, and <hi>raiſing reproaches on them,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>liberty</hi> of their <hi>conſcience</hi> threatned day by day, and <hi>impaired</hi> very much every day by thoſe that <hi>ſtay at home here,</hi> and <hi>eat the fat</hi> the while; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they do not (as diverſe have done) <hi>lay down</hi> their Armes, and ſay, I ſee my <hi>conſcience</hi> will be in <hi>ſlavery</hi> when all is done, and I have <hi>ventured</hi> my life: therefore I will go <hi>beyond Sea,</hi> as many <hi>godly</hi> men have done: but they <hi>reſolve,</hi> I will <hi>die</hi> for the Parliament, let them take away my <hi>liberty,</hi> and make me a <hi>ſlave,</hi> yet we <hi>will</hi> do it, all the <hi>reproaches</hi> cannot diſcourage them; it is the <hi>joy</hi> of their ſouls, when they hear of a <hi>skirmiſh,</hi> or a <hi>fight,</hi> they <hi>leap.</hi> What a glorious ſpirit is on <hi>Engliſh</hi> men!</p>
            <p>Therefore (I beſeech you) take heed of calling <hi>light</hi> darkneſſe, there is nothing that <hi>provokes God</hi> more: take heed of <hi>raiſing,</hi> and <hi>nouriſhing</hi> a curſed <hi>reproach</hi> againſt the Saints. I ſay not againſt <hi>Independents,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> but I ſay againſt <hi>godly</hi> men: I will ſtand to it, there is the <hi>hatred</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>godlineſse</hi> in them, and then they put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Independents:</hi> but they are <hi>blind wretches</hi> that <hi>hate god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> men, and ſeek to <hi>ruine</hi> the Kingdom, and to <hi>cut the throats</hi> of them. Therefore take heed, <hi>honour</hi> thoſe that <hi>God honours,</hi> If <hi>God</hi> have <hi>honoured</hi> them, and they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:117675:64"/> 
               <hi>honour God,</hi> and <hi>love God,</hi> let us in and for God give them <hi>honour</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Shall I <hi>teach</hi> you another word (and ſo I have done) Learn hence by <hi>experience</hi> (though it be not the beſt miſtreſs) to ſet forward <hi>godly</hi> men (as much as you can) to the work. It is not a <hi>dallying</hi> time; the Kingdom is almoſt <hi>ſunk,</hi> and we have made <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of men, and <hi>things</hi> to try <hi>concluſions,</hi> till we have almoſt <hi>ruined</hi> the Kingdom, though we ſee it not here. It is not a time to <hi>dally</hi> when the Kingdom <hi>gaſps,</hi> you know there is a party of <hi>wicked</hi> men at <hi>Oxford:</hi> here was a great company of <hi>treacherous men choſen for the Parliament</hi> that went to the <hi>King:</hi> Then we have had <hi>experience</hi> of all <hi>Committees,</hi> what things are done by men that are not <hi>right,</hi> that are not <hi>godly,</hi> I meane, not that are not of this or that <hi>faction,</hi> but that are not <hi>godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Learn, and O that <hi>God</hi> would teach <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and all to be <hi>wiſe</hi> at laſt, that now in all <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>occaſions</hi> of war, and at <hi>home,</hi> and in <hi>Committees</hi> and any thing. Look not how I may <hi>pleaſe</hi> my <hi>Landlord,</hi> or how I may pleaſe ſuch a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> but if he be a <hi>faithfull godly</hi> man, O ſet him forward. That is the way to <hi>ſave</hi> this poor Kingdom, you will never <hi>ſave</hi> it as long as you ſay, I have ſuch a <hi>kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and he ſhall be a <hi>Colonel,</hi> and I have ſuch a <hi>Coſen-German,</hi> and he ſhall be a <hi>Committee man,</hi> you will never do <hi>good</hi> ſo. Therefore if God would, and O that he would put it into the hearts of the <hi>Parliament</hi> to imploy <hi>godly</hi> men in this <hi>Army,</hi> that lay <hi>idle</hi> before, and did nothing: you ſee how the Lord hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>bleſſed</hi> them, you ſee things done that have not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:117675:64"/> been done in our <hi>age</hi> before, ſuch <hi>ſucceſsions</hi> of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and <hi>worthy actions.</hi> Therefore imploy <hi>godly</hi> men, <hi>faithfull men, Presbyterians,</hi> or <hi>Independents,</hi> look not at that, but ſee if they be <hi>godly</hi> men. Let us pray to the <hi>Lord</hi> that God may do it, that <hi>God</hi> may put it into the <hi>hearts</hi> of all ſo to do.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay two or three words more, and ſo I have done.</p>
            <p>One is, from this of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> learn to believe that the <hi>ſtrongeſt afflictions</hi> will work for our good. We know this was a <hi>ſtrong</hi> affliction, a <hi>ſore</hi> affliction that had confounded. There was not a man of us when we came out of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that could render a <hi>reaſon,</hi> what God did mean in <hi>ſhaming</hi> our <hi>prayers,</hi> and our <hi>preaching,</hi> and in <hi>ſcattering</hi> the poor <hi>Saints:</hi> it <hi>amazed</hi> us, we knew not what it meant, yet now we ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God did mean to do our ſouls <hi>good;</hi> God hath done the ſouls of many of his people <hi>good,</hi> and God will do their <hi>bodies</hi> good, and every thing ſhall be for the beſt; and we hope alſo, that they now knowing what the <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>oppreſsion</hi> of the Enemy is, it will make them more carefull to ſave the <hi>City,</hi> whereas before, all the world could not make the generality <hi>confident</hi> to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> but now we ſee God was <hi>wiſer</hi> then we, therefore if God bring <hi>ſtrong afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on our ſelves, or our wives, or children, that we know not what to make of them, let us learn to be <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> and to ſee that God means us well, and that it ſhall turn to our good.</p>
            <p>Another thing is this, that you may learn a little for your <hi>ſouls</hi> from it, to reaſon from the <hi>greater</hi> to the <hi>leaſt,</hi> and from the <hi>leaſt</hi> to the <hi>greater,</hi> it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:117675:65"/> way of Scripture, <hi>If God hath given us his Son, ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi> So, I ſay, thus me thinks you and I may reaſon, that the Lord that hath <hi>battered</hi> thoſe <hi>Forts,</hi> thoſe <hi>Caſtles,</hi> or done as good as <hi>broken</hi> them, that all their preparations theſe two years could not <hi>keep</hi> them, but God hath thrown them <hi>down;</hi> why ſhould I not hope that God will batter down the <hi>bulwark</hi> in my <hi>heart?</hi> I <hi>prayed,</hi> and you <hi>prayed</hi> that God would deliver that <hi>Caſtle</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> and thoſe things to our Forces, and they were <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>mighty,</hi> and God did it, and ſhall not the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Bulwarks</hi> that <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> hath in my <hi>heart</hi> be thrown down? Truly, that ſhould help our faith a little to follow God to <hi>throw down</hi> the one as he hath the other. Thoſe <hi>ſtrong hodls,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſtrong luſts</hi> that are there, <hi>unbelief</hi> and <hi>worldlineſs,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>wantonneſs,</hi> and ſuch like things that are in the <hi>ſouls</hi> of people variouſly. Methinks this might <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> our confidence, and ſtir up our more <hi>earneſt prayers</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> that he would be pleaſed to <hi>throw down</hi> theſe, as he did the Works of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and to make way for the <hi>King of glory</hi> to come into them.</p>
            <p>And I could wiſh laſtly, that you would <hi>help</hi> poor <hi>Briſtol</hi> people a little, as much as you can to ſettle them <hi>comfortably</hi> in their habitations according as the <hi>Parliament</hi> gave order, for they will finde <hi>naked</hi> walls there; and if there be any thing, the <hi>Plague</hi> having been there, it may be they dare not go in. Therefore <hi>incourage</hi> them, <hi>pray</hi> for them, and if it be in your power any way, <hi>help</hi> them a little, for they are but a <hi>few</hi> that are here, and <hi>weak. Pray</hi> for them that they may have good <hi>Officers,</hi> and good <hi>Common-Counſel-men,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:117675:65"/> and good <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the like, you have more <hi>friends</hi> that live here, and it may be more <hi>underſtanding</hi> then they have, and now is the time if you can do any thing, <hi>help</hi> them a little in that: otherwiſe for them to go <hi>home,</hi> among a company of <hi>carnal</hi> Aldermen, and <hi>carnal</hi> Common Counſelmen, and <hi>carnal</hi> Miniſters, what help ſhall they have?

            <p>One is, that the <hi>mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted.</hi> That is, the <hi>Church</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:117675:66"/> 
               <hi>people</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>things</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſhall be <hi>exalted</hi> in this world <hi>above</hi> all other things. You know now that the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>beneath</hi> all other powers, and the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>beneath</hi> all other Kingdomes, and the people of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are <hi>beneath</hi> all other people, and the Ordinances of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are <hi>beneath</hi> all other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: but in the <hi>latter</hi> times, <hi>the Mountain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> The time ſhall come when God ſhall <hi>raiſe</hi> his <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> and his <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>ordinances,</hi> and every thing of <hi>his,</hi> above the world, that the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall be <hi>more</hi> glorious, and <hi>more</hi> reſpected then all the people in the <hi>world</hi> beſides.</p>
            <p>And therefore you that are <hi>Saints:</hi> be not <hi>troubled</hi> to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo <hi>low</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> it grieves them to ſee how every baſe thing gets <hi>over Chriſt,</hi> to ſee how <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his things are <hi>trampled</hi> on in the world. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is as a <hi>Worm,</hi> thou <hi>worm Jacob,</hi> every childe may put his <hi>foot</hi> upon the <hi>head</hi> of a Worm: ſo are all the things of <hi>God,</hi> and have been hitherto, but in <hi>times to come</hi> the Lord ſhall <hi>raiſe his Mountain above all other mountains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing promiſed is, that in the <hi>laſt</hi> times, <hi>Many Nations ſhall come and ſay, Come let us go up to the Houſe of the Lord, and to the Mountain of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> ſhall be <hi>exalted,</hi> there will be a greater <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt</hi> among the people then ever there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the <hi>extent</hi> of it, <hi>Many Nations ſhall come and ſay.</hi> Whereas now, moſt of the <hi>Nations</hi> of the world are <hi>ignorant</hi> of, or <hi>enemies</hi> to the things
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:117675:67"/> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> there are <hi>few Nations</hi> that hear of the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but then <hi>many Nations ſhall come, many Nations</hi> that lye in <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and <hi>darkneſs, God</hi> will finde a way to <hi>ſpread</hi> the ſavor of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, then there ſhall be a great deal of <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs</hi> to come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his holy <hi>Ordinances,</hi> they ſhall ſay, <hi>Come let us go up to the mountain of the Houſe of the Lord, and they ſhal flow to it.</hi> Now you know what a deal of <hi>preaching</hi> there is to bring home one ſoul to <hi>God;</hi> a man may <hi>preach,</hi> and <hi>preach,</hi> and ſearce ever a one brought <hi>home</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> pours but a little of his <hi>Spirit</hi> with <hi>preaching,</hi> we are to bleſs his Name for any, but the time ſhall come, that as ſoon as the people <hi>hear</hi> they ſhall <hi>obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The people ſhall flow unto,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word is taken from the <hi>Tide:</hi> there are two things meant by it,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That then <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>people</hi> ſhall come in to the <hi>Lord,</hi> for the <hi>Tide comes in with waves,</hi> and <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of water, it comes not with a <hi>little</hi> water, but with <hi>multitudes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it comes with <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> that goes through all <hi>oppoſition.</hi> We ſee now it is not ſo, the Lord gives but <hi>little</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and therefore there are but <hi>few</hi> that come in to God, and of thoſe <hi>few,</hi> many of them, every little thing turns them off, one is afraid of <hi>perſecution,</hi> another of the <hi>loſs</hi> of his <hi>eſtate,</hi> another of the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>friends,</hi> another of the <hi>loſs</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> but then they ſhall flow.</p>
            <p>Another thing in this Promiſe of this glorious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is this: as they ſhall <hi>flow,</hi> ſo alſo they ſhall be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:117675:67"/> their hearts ſhall be <hi>inlarged</hi> to learn abundance of the Will of God, and <hi>moulded</hi> to a willingneſs to obey it. This is not accompliſhed yet, <hi>They ſhall then ſay, Come, let us go to the houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>He will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Now you know there is but little <hi>teaching.</hi> Indeed <hi>God teacheth</hi> ſome few <hi>wondrouſly,</hi> more aboundantly then we can <hi>teach,</hi> but yet there be many, though we <hi>ſpeak</hi> much, and though they live under the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> yet they <hi>learn</hi> little; and then that <hi>little</hi> that they do learn, there is very <hi>little power</hi> that goes along to <hi>frame</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> to do it, but then they ſhall ſay,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>We will walk in his ways.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>There will be a <hi>power,</hi> that when the Saints hear the <hi>word</hi> from God, they ſhall not be alway <hi>wiſhing,</hi> and <hi>woulding,</hi> and ſay I <hi>would I could do ſo:</hi> but there ſhall be a <hi>power</hi> with the <hi>word,</hi> whereby they ſhall be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>Another thing promiſed in the laſt times is, that,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>They ſhall be at their ſwords into plow-ſhares and their ſpeares into pruning hooks,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Lord</hi> will end theſe <hi>wars</hi> that are among the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that make the lives of people and of the <hi>Saints</hi> uncomfortable. And eſpecially (as I take it with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the people of God that are wiſe) that the <hi>wars</hi> here <hi>principally</hi> meant are <hi>wars</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the verſes following, <hi>they ſhal be at their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks.</hi> They ſhall then give over wars, and live <hi>peaceably</hi> together; whereas you know now moſt of the wars in the world are about <hi>Religion.</hi> The <hi>Turk</hi> would come, and <hi>ſubdue</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:117675:68"/> 
               <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to ſet up the <hi>worſhip</hi> of his <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> would deſtroy him to ſet up his <hi>Religion;</hi> and ſo all over the world there is a diſpoſition, that with <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>fagot,</hi> and <hi>ſword,</hi> and <hi>ſpear;</hi> we would bring men to worſhip God, every man according to his own <hi>fancie,</hi> But (ſaith he) then there ſhall be no ſuch <hi>wars, every man ſhall ſit under his own vine, and under his own fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and none ſhall make them afraid, The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Then they ſhall be <hi>quiet,</hi> there ſhall not be ſuch <hi>perſecuting</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all people will walk, every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is the reaſon why I think it is meant of <hi>wars</hi> about <hi>Religion:</hi> becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>all people will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of our God alſo.</hi> That is, people ſhall not be <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>worſhip</hi> this or that God, or this way, or that way, with <hi>ſword,</hi> and <hi>ſpear,</hi> but they ſhall <hi>all ſit under their own vines:</hi> that ſhall be the fruit of that <hi>abundance</hi> of teaching that there will be, <hi>every Nation will walk in the name of his</hi> God, and we <hi>will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not (beloved) but that the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> hath <hi>left,</hi> and doth ſtill <hi>continue</hi> to the end of the world a way of <hi>ſpirituall cenſure,</hi> and <hi>puniſhments</hi> for people that ſin againſt him. It is not meant that people in the laſt times ſhall go <hi>where</hi> they will, and do <hi>what</hi> they liſt; no, we have <hi>ordinances</hi> in the Church <hi>given</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the <hi>correction</hi> of thoſe that walk <hi>inordinately;</hi> we are to <hi>deliver</hi> our ſelves from them, and to <hi>deliver them up to Satan.</hi> But in reſpect of the <hi>main courſe</hi> that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:117675:68"/> the <hi>world</hi> hath been in, and is to this day, they ſhall not then be under <hi>cenſures</hi> for thoſe <hi>nifles,</hi> and <hi>trifles,</hi> as hitherto the way hath been by <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>fagot,</hi> and <hi>ſword:</hi> but (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>it ſhall not be ſo then, every one ſhall walk in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then here is another mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In that day ſaith the Lord will I aſſemble her that halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted, and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was caſt afar off a ſtrong Nation, and the Lord ſhall reign over them in Mount Zion, from henceforth even for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, we may know the <hi>worth</hi> of mercies, by the <hi>preſence</hi> of miſeries; we ſee now ſome <hi>halting,</hi> ſome <hi>runing</hi> into errours, and blaſphemies, and we know not what to do: but then <hi>the Lord will make them that halt a remnant;</hi> the Lord will <hi>gather</hi> the people that <hi>halt</hi> and go <hi>aſide,</hi> and he will <hi>ſettle,</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> them in the truth. Theſe are the <hi>thoughts</hi> of the Lord, and the <hi>counſells</hi> of <hi>God</hi> concerning the <hi>laſt</hi> dayes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are the while to <hi>wait patiently</hi> for the Lord, and to <hi>pray earneſtly</hi> that God would make good his <hi>promiſe</hi> to us: and not to <hi>looſe</hi> our ſelves (as we are apt) to ſee the <hi>diſorders</hi> and <hi>confuſions</hi> of Churches and <hi>Common-wealths</hi> in theſe days. But as people that are in a <hi>ſtorm,</hi> we ſhould look when the <hi>cloud</hi> will be over, that the Lord will give <hi>fairer weather,</hi> and <hi>remove</hi> all theſe things, when the <hi>laſt,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> dayes ſhall come.

            </p>
            <p>Then thirdly, the Saints live by faith, that is, <hi>the life</hi>

By <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, when God gives them the <hi>knowledge of ſenſe,</hi> they muſt not <hi>ſhut their eyes</hi> one day that they have it, but our eyes are ſo <hi>dim</hi> that we are ready to <hi>miſtake;</hi> ſo that the maine courſe of a mans <hi>life</hi> is by <hi>faith from Gods love in Chriſt</hi> in the free <hi>Covenant,</hi> which <hi>Covenant</hi> conſiſts in ſuch <hi>promiſes,</hi> which <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> ſpeak to me by ſuch <hi>ordinances</hi> as this, and the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a third way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the <hi>Saints live by faith,</hi> that is, <hi>in all afflictions they do bear up their ſpirits, and are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4. It is their ſupport in afflictions.</note> 
               <hi>by the power of faith upon the word,</hi> though there be nothing ſeen, and appear. A <hi>naturall</hi> man cannot <hi>hold up,</hi> but <hi>ſink,</hi> further then there is ſome <hi>ſenſible,</hi> viſible thing to <hi>hold him up:</hi> but the <hi>juſt,</hi> thoſe that are <hi>Saints,</hi> they have an <hi>art,</hi> a <hi>myſticall art,</hi> whereby when they <hi>ſee</hi> nothing, but have a <hi>word,</hi> wherein God hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to do this, or that for them, they can <hi>bear up</hi> themſelves, and ſo go on as <hi>chearfully</hi> as if they did <hi>enjoy,</hi> or as if they did <hi>ſee</hi> their deliverance. Thus <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> we read, this proverb. verſe 1, 2, 3. <hi>The viſion is for an appointed time, in the end it will ſpeak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:117675:70"/> 
               <hi>come, it will not tary, Behold, his ſoul which is lifted up, is not upright in him; but the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a <hi>viſion</hi> that did <hi>promiſe good</hi> to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but this <hi>viſion</hi> muſt <hi>tarry</hi> a little, it muſt not be performed <hi>preſently:</hi> but they might ſay, how ſhall we do in the <hi>mean while? The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> Though there be nothing <hi>ſeen,</hi> yet notwithſtanding they ſhall <hi>bear</hi> themſelves, and <hi>carry</hi> themſelves <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> and <hi>comfortably,</hi> and <hi>contentedly</hi> by beholding the <hi>truth</hi> of the buſines, and the ſweet <hi>expectation</hi> they have of it, as if it were <hi>come</hi> already. You have the proverb repeated by the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in this ſenſe, <hi>yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry. You have need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. They were in great <hi>afflictions,</hi> there was a <hi>promiſe</hi> that God would <hi>help</hi> them, but what ſhall we do in the meane <hi>while,</hi> while the <hi>graſſe grows?</hi> In the meane while the <hi>juſt ſhall live by his faith;</hi> he ſhall <hi>drive on</hi> and <hi>carry on the work,</hi> and <hi>bear up</hi> himſelf, and his ſpirit, and his comfort, and all on the <hi>word of the Lord,</hi> and he ſhall do all this by his <hi>faith.</hi> So that this being the leſſon ſhortly (though I be not able yet to <hi>clear</hi> this fully to you: for truly this is a leſſon wherein we ſtill ſhall want <hi>light,</hi> we are not able to ſee it perfectly, it is <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. That is, we come from <hi>one degree</hi> of faith to <hi>another</hi> to <hi>live by faith:</hi> there are <hi>many kinds, many degrees</hi> of living by <hi>faith)</hi> Now this is it that I would commend to you, and exhort you to, that you would <hi>ſeek</hi> the Lord, and <hi>ſtudy</hi> the Scriptures, that you might come to this, that you may <hi>live by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:117675:71"/>
            <p> Firſt of all, in the groſſer part of it, concerning <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> (that is an eaſie thing to be underſtood) that you would not <hi>regard,</hi> or <hi>weigh</hi> any thing in all your <hi>profeſsion,</hi> but what doth come from <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi> Truly, much of our <hi>Religion,</hi> is a <hi>naturall</hi> kinde of Religion, and much of that which is like good in us, doth not <hi>ſpring</hi> from <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and whatſoever is not <hi>from him,</hi> will never be accepted <hi>by him.</hi> We have many <hi>morall vertues</hi> from old <hi>Adam,</hi> that we <hi>gild</hi> over, and account them <hi>graces,</hi> but God <hi>loaths</hi> them. We have many duties that we have <hi>taken up</hi> in the imitation of others, by <hi>good education</hi> or the <hi>power of the letter</hi> Preached to us, and yet this is not the <hi>life of faith,</hi> it is not <hi>holineſse by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, let us not (like many profeſſors) ſtudy the <hi>muchneſſe</hi> of Religion, or the <hi>plauſibleneſſe</hi> of it without; as that I am able to <hi>preach,</hi> as other <hi>preachers</hi> do, and you are able to <hi>pray</hi> in a day of <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> as other profeſſors do, this is nothing: but let us labour that that <hi>little holineſse</hi> that is in us, may clearly <hi>proceed</hi> from the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> One had better have a Garden of a few <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> Flowers, though there be but a <hi>few,</hi> then to have a Garden with <hi>ſome Flowers,</hi> and a world of <hi>traſh</hi> like Flowers, there is no <hi>pleaſure</hi> in it. Now, I fear that much of thy beſt <hi>duties ſpring</hi> from <hi>old Adam,</hi> much of thy beſt <hi>prayers,</hi> and much (it may be) of that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> whereby thou art <hi>accounted</hi> a profeſſor: much of it, I fear, is nothing but <hi>old Adam,</hi> and his <hi>ruines</hi> ſcrewed up, and varniſhed, or gilded, and not from the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore remember this, that as <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:117675:71"/> and <hi>whoredom,</hi> and thoſe groſſe, and ſcandalous <hi>works of darkneſſe,</hi> are called <hi>dead works,</hi> ſo every <hi>graine,</hi> every <hi>ſtamp</hi> of good in thee, if it be not from the <hi>new Adam,</hi> it is but a <hi>dead work.</hi> I could ſhew you how you ſhall know the one from the other, but that the time is ſhort, and I muſt not hinder other occaſions; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave that upon your thoughts that you may pray to the <hi>Lord:</hi> Lord; I do not care how men <hi>conceive</hi> of me, I care not though I be among the <hi>leaſt of all Saints,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, if <hi>I be reckoned the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> ſo that that little Saint-ſhip, and holineſſe that is in me <hi>flow from Chriſt,</hi> that it be a grace from <hi>his grace,</hi> and light from <hi>his light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the other truth is wondrous hard to expreſſe, that we ſhould in reſpect of <hi>juſtification,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> learn the Art of <hi>living by faith,</hi> that when the Lord ſhall take away all <hi>comfortable objects of ſight,</hi> and <hi>ſenſe,</hi> that we can <hi>ſee</hi> nothing, we cannot <hi>pray</hi> at all; we ſee <hi>corruption</hi> upon <hi>corruption,</hi> and <hi>waves</hi> of temptations one upon another, and no <hi>working</hi> within to relieve us, that I am able then to <hi>live by faith;</hi> that is, to ſee a <hi>righteouſneſſe in Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>build</hi> upon his <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> to hold my ſelf, and my <hi>aſſurance</hi> ſtill, I am a <hi>ſon</hi> ſtill, <hi>everlaſting life</hi> belongs to me ſtill, though I <hi>feele,</hi> and ſee nothing, but <hi>hell,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe if it may be, yet notwithſtanding I am a <hi>Saint,</hi> and I am <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and the Lord is my <hi>father,</hi> and hath reſerved <hi>everlaſting life</hi> for me.</p>
            <p>Beloved, the life that Chriſtians ordinarily do live, it is a life <hi>mingled</hi> with faith, and ſenſe: for if God give me <hi>free grace,</hi> why ſhould not I rejoyce in it? If I clearly ſee the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of the Kingdom of heaven,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:117675:72"/> why ſhould I exclude my reaſon not to conclude that there is <hi>more grace</hi> behind?</p>
            <p>But there are <hi>other Saints</hi> that have a <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> and ſenſe, that take away ſenſe, and their <hi>faith</hi> is gone, their <hi>faith</hi> is grounded upon ſenſe. And I have oft times looked in to my ſoul, and thought why the Lord ſuffered me to be carryed away with <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and to be overwhelmed with <hi>temptations,</hi> whereas <hi>he hates</hi> theſe things, and <hi>I hate</hi> them, and I <hi>weary him,</hi> and <hi>they weary</hi> me, and he can help it, and I cannot; why he ſhould do thus, to ſuffer me to pray, and I cannot overcome? There are many reaſons the Lord hath given in to my ſoul from time to time: but of all reaſons this is the chief, that the Lord thereby would inure us to live by <hi>faith.</hi> The Lord comes many times when we are compaſſed about with <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and can go as you do into your Gardens, and take now one Flower, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and make a poſie of <hi>grace,</hi> I behold my <hi>love</hi> to the Saints, and my <hi>delight</hi> in God, and my <hi>uprightneſse</hi> in my calling, and I make a <hi>poſie</hi> of them, God comes and <hi>daſhes</hi> it all, every jot, and what ſhall I ſay now? Now for a man to be able to take up a <hi>promiſe</hi> that the <hi>juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> that is, I am ſtill as juſt as ever I was, and I am <hi>aſſured</hi> of it (in a ſort) as much as ever, without the leaſt graine of any thing <hi>felt</hi> or <hi>ſeen,</hi> and I bear up my profeſſion, and all my works, as if I had thoſe <hi>views</hi> of graces that once I had, now all is gone. Whereas, ordinarily when God daſheth all this way, what is the fruit of it? Then a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, I am an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> I am a <hi>damned creature,</hi> I
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:117675:72"/> cannot believe, then I muſt ſit in a holy moping, why? becauſe ſenſe is gone, <hi>faith</hi> is gone almoſt, <hi>faith</hi> ſtays no longer then <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and that is a ſigne that you alway lived by <hi>ſenſe:</hi> God takes occaſion many times to <hi>daſh</hi> all that ever is in us, and that ever hath been done by us; God will write <hi>hypocriſie</hi> upon it, he will make us <hi>read</hi> ſo at leaſt, doſt thou ſee what thou art? There is no creature <hi>more carnall;</hi> and in that thou haſt done, there is this <hi>crookedneſſe,</hi> and that <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> there is this <hi>guile,</hi> and that, all is <hi>naught.</hi> Then the Lord by this teaches one to go a <hi>high-lone,</hi> without <hi>crutches;</hi> one of theſe <hi>faintings</hi> teacheth one to go without a <hi>ſtaffe,</hi> alone. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo is the glory of God, that is glorious in all his works of creation, and providence, glorious in war, <hi>knapping the ſpear aſunder:</hi> but his glory in the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> is more, that uſually when God hath ſhewed a Saint his <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> to <hi>magnifie</hi> his <hi>grace</hi> the more, then ordinarily, God takes theſe times to do more for a poor ſoul, then ever he did at any time: the Lord will then give a <hi>new ſeal</hi> of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſins, and <hi>new diſcoveries</hi> of the <hi>myſteries</hi> of the Goſpell, and of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in the midſt of theſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions.</hi> But it is the hardeſt thing in the world, to live <hi>clearly by faith</hi> when ſenſe is gone; there is that I drive at all this while. I ſee poor creatures mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where, and when <hi>ſenſe</hi> is out, then their candle is out, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>How oft is the candle of the wicked put out?</hi> So, that Saint that lives by ſenſe, his comfort is no longer then he <hi>ſees,</hi> and <hi>feels</hi> grace, he hath <hi>aſſurance</hi> of Gods love no longer
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:117675:73"/> then he <hi>feels</hi> grace. So there are but few of you that have a <hi>root of faith,</hi> that in all the ebbings, and flowings of grace, your <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> by Faith goes on in its courſe as before. Now deſire the Lord to bring you to this clearely, that according to this bleſſed proverb you may <hi>live by faith.</hi>

Whereupon, ſaith our <hi>Lord,</hi> you may ſee how <hi>hard it is for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of heaven, A Camell may go thorow the eye of a needle as ſoone.</hi> Whereupon his Diſciples replied in a <hi>vanting</hi> way, crowing over the man, <hi>Maſter, what ſhall we have?</hi> we have done gallantly, <hi>we have forſaken all that we have, and have followed thee; what ſhall we have therefore?</hi> Saith our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> You ſhall have a large <hi>reward</hi> I confeſſe, <hi>I ſay unto you.

And every one that hath forſaken houſes, or land, or children, or father, or mother, or wife for my names ſake; ſhall receive an hundred fold here, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life.</hi> For, ſaith he (he puts this correction upon it) here is a large reward, as if he ſhould ſay, if the <hi>young</hi> man had followed my <hi>advice</hi> he had been no <hi>loſer,</hi> nor you ſhall not, <hi>but many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I would not have you to be <hi>proud,</hi> and to <hi>crow</hi> over that poor man that is run from me, becauſe you <hi>are old Diſciples;</hi> it may be that man may <hi>come back</hi> again to me, and be my <hi>beſt ſervant</hi> when you may <hi>run</hi> away: <hi>for many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi> And thereupon our Lord in the next Chapter, on purpoſe to this end to <hi>bring down</hi> their ſpirits, he expreſſeth himſelf in a whole parable of <hi>a man that hired ſervants,</hi> and he that came at the <hi>laſt hour received as much as he that came at the beginning of the day;</hi> he takes down their ſpirits from being <hi>too high</hi> over poor ſinners.

               <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I ſay, many <hi>ſinners,</hi> and <hi>ſlow</hi> profeſſors, ſhall be <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>formoſt</hi> in the ways of godlines; and many <hi>old profeſſors</hi> that have been <hi>once</hi> zealous, ſhall be <hi>laſt,</hi> and <hi>loweſt</hi> in the formes of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>godlineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not tell you that there are <hi>ſeverall formes</hi> of godlineſſe. There are (as Iohn ſaith) <hi>fathers,</hi> and <hi>young men,</hi> and <hi>children;</hi> there is the <hi>weak,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrong,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:117675:74"/> the <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and the <hi>carnall.</hi> Now God (I ſay) hath caſt it ſo that ordinarily the <hi>weak</hi> ſhall outrun the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> the <hi>childe</hi> ſhall go before his <hi>father,</hi> the <hi>young, green, ſlow</hi> profeſſors; ſhall be in heaven, and the way to heaven before the <hi>old</hi> profeſſor, and they that were <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall be <hi>laſt,</hi> and they that were <hi>laſt</hi> ſhall now be <hi>firſt.</hi> For the opening of it, it is to be underſtood two ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all you are to underſtand this, <hi>that the firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt,</hi> not as an <hi>univerſall, generall</hi> rule, that <hi>every</hi> young profeſſor ſhall outſtrip an old: but the way to Heaven is ſo narrow, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, <hi>abundance</hi> of them do fall away. And few men fall away at the firſt: but when the <hi>tryall</hi> comes, when the <hi>Sun ariſeth,</hi> as our Lord ſaith. So a learned expoſiter upon it ſaith, that it may be thirty, or fourty, or fifty, or ſixty yeers among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, there may be many <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and there are more that have but a <hi>common work</hi> of the ſpirit of God: thereupon our <hi>Lord</hi> ſpeaking onely to profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſuch as they were, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. where he ſaith three of the four were rotten, and come to nothing, and the fourth only hold out. <hi>Some mens ſins are open before</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) and ſome follow after.</hi> We ſee it by ſome men <hi>ſetting out</hi> in Religion, they never come to any thing: <hi>but ſome mens ſins follow after.</hi> Some men go far, and walk gloriouſly, and <hi>afterward</hi> are diſcovered. And truly, it is a rule among the beſt of our miniſters, that ſeldome or never, <hi>hypocrites</hi> go out of this world <hi>undiſcovered:</hi> And hence it comes to paſſe by the falls of <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and thoſe that have not a <hi>ſaving work</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> that great ones <hi>fall away,</hi> and little, low ones <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip</hi> them.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:117675:75"/>
            <p> Secondly, it comes to paſſe that the <hi>firſt are laſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt firſt,</hi> becauſe the Lord for reaſons beſt known to himſelf for the moſt part ſo <hi>caſts</hi> it, that even among true <hi>profeſſors,</hi> true <hi>Saints,</hi> the moſt part of them when they grow ancient (in Religion eſpecially) they take a <hi>napp</hi> before they go hence. They go as <hi>travellers</hi> in the way, that go out betime in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but take a <hi>baite</hi> of two or three hours in the way, and ſo <hi>ſlow</hi> travellers get before them. There is not one in ten ordinarily, but hath a ſhrewd <hi>napp</hi> when he is ancient in Religion, before he go hence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we ſee the ten Virgins, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. <hi>The wiſe Virgins ſlept as well as the fooliſh,</hi> they all <hi>ſlept:</hi> but the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> awaked in <hi>time,</hi> and got up again, and the fooliſh <hi>ſlept it out.</hi> And while they are <hi>napping</hi> and <hi>ſleeping,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> becomes laſt, and the <hi>laſt</hi> firſt. For we may not think that all ſuch <hi>ancient</hi> profeſſors, that they have <hi>no grace.</hi> We ſee now, are there not ſome <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and many <hi>Miniſters,</hi> old <hi>non-conformiſts,</hi> that are now generally <hi>napping,</hi> and <hi>ſleeping,</hi> that you would think there were <hi>nothing</hi> of God in them? we may not think that they belong not to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and that they have no <hi>grace.</hi> This is the time when many ſimple ſouls get into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>knowledg</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have further <hi>enjoyments</hi> of ſpirit, and <hi>communion</hi> of ſpirit with him, then thoſe grave <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths</hi> men, that before held out <hi>Religion</hi> more then others: yet we are not to think that they have no <hi>grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore of this briefly, there are theſe four or five practicall leſſons that we ſhould learn.</p>

               <hi>ancient</hi> profeſſors, if ye <hi>ſtand,</hi> to <hi>take heed leaſt ye fall.</hi> How ſhould this me thinks make an <hi>ancient</hi> Saint <hi>watch?</hi> how ſhould he <hi>avoid ſecurity,</hi> when it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for <hi>old</hi> Chriſtians to take a <hi>napp,</hi> and ſo not to be <hi>higher</hi> in Heaven; they loſe much of their <hi>glory</hi> in Heaven; nay they loſe their <hi>honour</hi> here, ye ſome men think them to be <hi>hypocrites.</hi> Therefore ſtand on your guard: ſay not, we have been profeſſors, twenty, or thirty, or fourty yeers, as <hi>ordinary</hi> profeſſors bragg of their <hi>ſtanding</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> No, but remember this leſſon, <hi>there are many firſt that ſhall be laſt:</hi> therefore walk <hi>watchfully,</hi> and <hi>circumſpectly.</hi> Think with your ſelves, and O that the Lord would open the eyes of <hi>ancient</hi> Chriſtians in this City, to ſee poor ſouls of a <hi>yeer,</hi> or <hi>half</hi> a yeers ſtanding, ſtart up, that have more of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them, and more <hi>clear knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> and love him more, and his Saints, and do more for him then they do.

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, let <hi>weak Saints,</hi> and <hi>young beginners,</hi> learn <note place="margin">3. Weak ones not to bear themſelves unreverently</note> hence alſo, as on the one ſide (that I may put in that <hi>caveat)</hi> not to behave themſelves <hi>unreverently</hi> toward the <hi>ancient.</hi> I would not have <hi>old Saints</hi> to <hi>crow</hi> over the <hi>young,</hi> muchleſſe the <hi>young</hi> over the <hi>ancient:</hi> Saith <hi>Paul, rebuke not an elder, but rather exhort him.</hi> If we in preaching muſt not ſpeak ſo <hi>ſharply</hi> to <hi>ancient Chriſtians,</hi> whether elders in <hi>Office,</hi> or rather in <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (as I believe it is) we muſt not <hi>rebuke</hi> him, but ſpeak with <hi>reverence,</hi> ſo much more <hi>young Chriſtians</hi> muſt ſpeak <hi>reverently,</hi> of <hi>ancient Chriſtians,</hi> and not ſay, there goes ſuch an <hi>old profeſsor,</hi> and ſuch a one ſaith, the <hi>firſt ſhall be laſt;</hi> and ſo deſpiſe him.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:117675:76"/> of <hi>petulant, wanton</hi> carriage towards <hi>old</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
            <p>So, on the other ſide, <hi>be not diſcouraged</hi> by ſeeing the <note place="margin">Neither to be diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> graces in <hi>ancient, ſtrong Chriſtians.</hi> It is an ordinary thing for <hi>weak Saints</hi> to be more <hi>diſcouraged</hi> at the <hi>graces</hi> of <hi>ſtrong Saints</hi> then at any thing elſe. As a <hi>weak eye</hi> that looks on the <hi>Sun</hi> can ſee juſt nothing; ſo many a <hi>weak ſoul</hi> hath the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of Gods ſpirit, that he walks <hi>uprightly</hi> in his family before the Lord: but if he fall into the company of <hi>ſpirituall Chriſtians</hi> that are <hi>full of the Spirit, full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> he comes home, proclaiming himſelf <hi>an hypocrite</hi> all the way as he goes. Do not that; for God hath caſt it ſo, that the <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall be laſt, and the <hi>laſt</hi> ſhall be firſt: therefore though I be <hi>weak,</hi> who knows but that God may make me equall to that <hi>glorious Saint?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he is not to be <hi>ſecure</hi> and <hi>proud,</hi> ſo I am not to be <hi>diſcouraged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly: learn alſo this leſſon (for it is of eſpeciall uſe in theſe times: for this is the age when <hi>old</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors <note place="margin">4. Not to judge others.</note> ſet themſelves to <hi>ſleep)</hi> learn hence, <hi>not to judg of Chriſtians, old Chriſtians, old</hi> profeſſors to be <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> becauſe that they have taken a <hi>napp.</hi> I may not think that that man whom I have known to be the <hi>firſt</hi> man for <hi>Religion,</hi> of all the <hi>Iuſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> of all the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in the country, of all the <hi>miniſters</hi> in the County: becauſe he is now the <hi>leaſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> of all the <hi>gentry,</hi> or <hi>miniſtery,</hi> or the like, I may not (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the ordinary <hi>faſhion</hi> of men is) conclude that there is <hi>no grace</hi> in him. It is an ordinary thing among us, you have <hi>inſtances</hi> every where in this caſe: but rather conclude this, that <hi>many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:117675:77"/> 
               <hi>the laſt ſhall be firſt, God hath put the one againſt the other, that we ſhould finde nothing after him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God delights in <hi>variety</hi> of works, and he hath <hi>caſt</hi> it ſo, that <hi>ordinarily</hi> profeſſors ſhould be like the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> or <hi>Iacobs ladder,</hi> ſome up, and ſome down, the young going <hi>before</hi> the old, and the old coming <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde</hi> the young, and as ſouldiers in <hi>training,</hi> wheele about, and go <hi>behinde</hi> one another. God in <hi>wiſdom</hi> hath done ſo; therefore I wil not ſay, ſuch a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or ſuch a <hi>miniſter,</hi> or ſuch a <hi>Gentleman</hi> doth not belong to <hi>God,</hi> becauſe he is not ſo good as he hath been, he was once the <hi>beſt,</hi> and now he is the <hi>leaſt,</hi> he may be the <hi>Lords</hi> notwithſtanding all this. We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, or elſe we ſhall make <hi>hypocrites</hi> of all the world: for there is no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> but hath his <hi>fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and if we conclude ſo, then God will have no <hi>Saints.</hi> It is a bleſſed meanes of <hi>meekning</hi> the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>napping Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then laſtly; let there be a kind of <hi>equality,</hi> and <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie and equality.</note> 
               <hi>correſpondencie</hi> between all <hi>Saints</hi> (O that God would have it ſo) that as the <hi>younger</hi> ſhould not carry themſelves <hi>unreverently</hi> to the elder, ſo the <hi>elder</hi> ſhould not <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the younger: but as there was an <hi>equality</hi> in their gathering of <hi>Mannah, they that had much, had nothing to ſpare, and they that had little had no want:</hi> ſo the Lord delights in <hi>equality</hi> among the <hi>Saints,</hi> God hates to ſee Chriſtians, that have much knowledge, to <hi>brow-beat</hi> weak Saints, God hates it. Let us love a kinde of <hi>equality,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie: For we are all one body, and have all one head:</hi> the <hi>greateſt member</hi> cannot ſay to the toe, <hi>I have no need of thee:</hi> the greateſt Chriſtian; if he be as an <hi>eye</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:117675:77"/> in the head, he cannot ſay that he hath not need of the <hi>weakeſt Saint:</hi> there is <hi>ſomething</hi> that may do him good, if he could <hi>ſee</hi> it.</p>
            <p>To end this, I will give you the expreſſion of <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Salute one another with an holy kiſs, the Churches of Chriſt ſalute you.</hi> The obſervation of Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place is this, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had before <hi>ſaluted</hi> a great many <hi>ſtrong</hi> Saints by <hi>name,</hi> and commended them for ſome <hi>excellencies,</hi> one for one thing, another for another, <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> as <hi>helpers</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch a one for ſuch a thing he gives commendation; now becauſe he names not all, leaſt the <hi>weak</hi> ſhould be offended, therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſalute one another with a holy kiſſe.</hi> It was their manner before their <hi>ſupper,</hi> they had <hi>feaſts of love,</hi> and before their <hi>feaſts of love,</hi> they did alway <hi>ſalute</hi> one another with an <hi>holy kiſſe;</hi> they <hi>kiſſed</hi> one another, and it was a <hi>Ceremony</hi> that God appointed to this end, to ſhew that there was a kinde of <hi>equality</hi> between all the <hi>Saints,</hi> that the <hi>pooreſt</hi> could not be kept at a <hi>diſtance</hi> from the <hi>rich,</hi> and the <hi>youngeſt</hi> Saint that the other day was a <hi>drunkard,</hi> or <hi>whoremonger,</hi> was not to be deſpiſed, but was <hi>kiſsed</hi> of the old. So that <hi>kiſs</hi> linked them together, that though there was <hi>difference,</hi> yet this kiſſe <hi>levell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Beloved, how far, this <hi>ceremony</hi> ſhould be practiſed by us, or we are bound to it, is more then I can tell, or any that I know: but that is ſignified by it holds, that there ſhould be a <hi>bleſſed correſpondencie</hi> between all the <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſome kinde of way, whereby a man that is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be he never ſo weak, may know that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:117675:78"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt accepts</hi> him, that the <hi>greateſt Saint,</hi> and moſt <hi>glorious</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> accepts him alſo. And not as the <hi>factious</hi> cuſtome of diſputing profeſſors is; that never take notice of, but ſcorn hundreds of <hi>poor Saints,</hi> that have not thoſe gifts, that cannot <hi>talk ſwelling, proud words,</hi> as <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith. All that are <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſhould be <hi>dear</hi> to us as they are <hi>dear</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he loves them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, he <hi>paid</hi> as much for them as he did for us; and God is their <hi>father.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> provided foreſeeing the diſpoſition of men in <hi>latter</hi> times, that of all <hi>Saints</hi> we ſhould take care of the <hi>weakeſt:</hi> therefore ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Peter, Peter, loveſt thou me? loveſt thou me? loveſt thou me? Lord, thou knoweſt all things,</hi> Well, I ſee thou loveſt me, as thou loveſt me <hi>feed my lambs.</hi> We are to feed the <hi>ſheep</hi> too: for <hi>Peter</hi> was a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erd, but we are to feed the <hi>lambs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> eſpecially. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. you know what care <hi>Chriſt</hi> takes of his <hi>little ones,</hi> he compares <hi>young profeſsors</hi> to little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and if any <hi>offend one of them, it were better that a Milſtone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> If you ſhould ſee a man in the <hi>midſt of the Sea</hi> with a <hi>Milſtone</hi> about his neck, it were a miſerable condition: ſo it is a ſad condition of <hi>high,</hi> and <hi>lofty profeſſors,</hi> that <hi>brow-beat</hi> weak Saints, that will not <hi>correſpond,</hi> or <hi>condeſcend</hi> to them of the <hi>lower</hi> ſort, O, ſaith <hi>Paul, who is weak and I am not offended? who is offended and I burn not?</hi> I will ſay no more of that, remember <hi>many that are firſt ſhall be laſt.</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:117675:79"/> which our <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> divers ways, by <hi>precept;</hi> and <hi>example,</hi> and <hi>parables,</hi> &amp;c. doth exhort <hi>his</hi> Diſciples to, to <hi>pray alway, and not to faint.</hi> So that this is it that you ſhould do well to conſider, that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer, or calling upon the name of God in Chriſt, is an ordinance, and a perpetuall ordinance of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though (it may be) many of you do not doubt of it, and therefore you think why ſhould I ſpeak of it? Truly, no more did not I <hi>doubt</hi> of it, yet I have had many <hi>thoughts</hi> of it: and though we doubt not of it, yet the conſidering of it out of the word may ſtir us up to do it <hi>more</hi> then we do: for I am afraid, though many of you <hi>doubt</hi> not of it, yet many of you are <hi>ſlack;</hi> and though you <hi>believe</hi> not what the others ſay, yet you hearken ſo much to them as to <hi>ſlacken</hi> of what the <hi>old Saints</hi> did, and of what your ſelves did before, you do not ſet your ſelves ſo <hi>earneſtly,</hi> and ſo <hi>frequently,</hi> and follow God ſo hard in <hi>prayer</hi> as you have done: this I greatly fear.</p>
            <p>For I find many times that the devill plays a <hi>double</hi> game, that when he comes to take away an <hi>ordinance</hi> from people, to <hi>cheat</hi> them of it, he knowes that ſome are ſo <hi>giddy,</hi> that he can <hi>gull,</hi> and <hi>cheat</hi> them clearly, and he knows this that thoſe that he cannot <hi>cheat</hi> yet he can caſt them into a <hi>kinde of remiſneſſe.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he hath taken away from many, <hi>ſinging</hi> of <hi>Pſalms, praſing God</hi> according to that manner that the <hi>Saints</hi> have had for divers ages, whereas there is no particular manner in the ſcriptures for the outward thing: now as he hath brought many that they will not <hi>ſing</hi> at all, ſo there are many that are <hi>indifferent;</hi> and ſo for <hi>baptiſing the infants of the godly,</hi> and ſo for

               <hi>hearing</hi> the <hi>Word;</hi> and ſo for <hi>praying.</hi> The devil hath a <hi>dilemma,</hi> if you will do ſo, ſo it is, or elſe do this; ſo I ſay while ſome <hi>giddy</hi> heads, or hearts are throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Ordinance of <hi>prayer.</hi> I am afraid there is a general <hi>remiſneſs,</hi> or <hi>careleſneſs</hi> growing upon your hearts, therefore I ſhall ſhew theſe two things concerning <hi>prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you that it is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prayer an Ordinance of God. Prayer a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual duty.</note> that it is a <hi>duty,</hi> that it is the <hi>duty of a Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you that it is a <hi>laſting</hi> duty, a duty to be performed <hi>in all ages</hi> untill the coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that briefly and plainly.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, That it is a <hi>duty,</hi> conſider any <hi>duty</hi> in the world, and whatſoever you would have to prove it a duty, I dare ſay it is clear in the <hi>Word</hi> concerning this <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> that, and much more, you cannot name any <hi>duty</hi> in the <hi>Book of God,</hi> any <hi>external duty</hi> that is <hi>underpropped,</hi> that hath ſuch <hi>foundations,</hi> ſuch clear <hi>ground-works</hi> for it as the duty of <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are four main <hi>grounds</hi> of duty, and one of <note place="margin">Four main grounds of dutie.</note> them many times is a ſufficient <hi>ground</hi> for any one, as</p>

                  </gap> of Nature.</note> written in the <hi>heart</hi> of man, to call upon God, it was written in the <hi>Creation.</hi> There are many duties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us that are not ſo, under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> eſpecially. Now that you ſee in all ages, all kinde of people <hi>call upon the name of their God.</hi> As in the ſhip where <hi>Jonah</hi> was; the <hi>Heathens</hi> by the <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> they awake <hi>Ionah</hi> to <hi>call</hi> on his God, and they were <hi>calling</hi> on their god: it is a thing in the <hi>law of Nature.</hi> And (by the By) that is the reaſon why we may <hi>pray</hi> with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:117675:80"/> 
               <hi>carnal</hi> men, though we may not receive the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> becauſe the Supper of the Lord is an <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> by <hi>inſtitution,</hi> the other is a natural <hi>Ordinance</hi> or <hi>duty.</hi> Now when a man doth a <hi>Natural</hi> duty, it is ſuppoſed that it is in the <hi>heart</hi> of a wicked man, and he doth but what he <hi>ought</hi> when he doth it. A <hi>carnal</hi> man when he <hi>prays</hi> he <hi>ſins,</hi> not in that he <hi>prays,</hi> much leſs do I ſin in doing the <hi>duty</hi> with him, in doing what he <hi>ought:</hi> But wherein doth he ſin? In the <hi>maner,</hi> that he prays without <hi>faith,</hi> it is his fault and not mine; and ſo an <hi>hypocrite</hi> that prayeth without <hi>faith:</hi> when I do the <hi>duty,</hi> I look that the <hi>thing</hi> be good, but for the <hi>maner</hi> of his heart, and ſpirit, that is for him to look to. So a man may <hi>pray</hi> with <hi>carnal people,</hi> though he may not receive the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord, becauſe that is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> by <hi>inſtitution,</hi> and is onely for the <hi>Saints.</hi> That by the by.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is this ground for it, for <hi>prayer</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Word.</note> we have more <hi>precepts</hi> then for any other dutie, Chriſt Jeſus ſaith here, <hi>Pray always,</hi> And the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. he bids us <hi>pray evermore,</hi> pray alway, I need not ſtand to prove this.</p>

               </hi> with a <hi>pure heart,</hi> they are <hi>Synonomies.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Grace, mercy, and peace to the Saints,</hi> ſometimes to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and ſometimes to thoſe <hi>that pray,</hi> and <hi>call on the name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. It is a thing ſo <hi>proper</hi> to a <hi>Saint,</hi> that it is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:117675:80"/> uſually taken for the <hi>deſcription</hi> of a <hi>Saint.</hi> Therefore in <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. where there is a Propheſie concerning the converſion of the <hi>Iews;</hi> ſaith <hi>God, I will poure on them the Spirit of Grace and Supplication.</hi> What is that? That is, they ſhall be <hi>converted.</hi> To have a <hi>ſpirit of Supplication,</hi> a <hi>praying heart</hi> is the ſame as <hi>converſion:</hi> to convert the <hi>Iews</hi> is to give them a <hi>ſpirit of Grace</hi> and <hi>Supplication:</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, Act.</hi> 9. when <hi>Ananias</hi> inquired of him, he was <hi>praying,</hi> therefore you have examples enow. <note place="margin">4. Promiſes entailed on it. Pſalm 50.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And then you have Precepts for it, and Promiſes to it, all along in the <hi>Book of God; Call upon me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee;</hi> So in the new Teſtament, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. And in the Epiſtles of <hi>Iohn; If we call upon God, he will hear our prayers, and grant our petitions,</hi> and if <hi>you ask any thing in the name of Chriſt, you ſhall have it.</hi> You know theſe things; onely I minde you, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles often minded them of what they knew already, leaſt they ſhould be carried away with the <hi>error of the wicked.</hi> That is one thing; it is an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> you ſee four great pillars under it, it hath the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> there are <hi>Precepts,</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what we <hi>pray</hi> for: And there are <hi>threatnings</hi> to thoſe that do it not, <hi>Curſe the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſaid it was an <hi>everlaſting</hi> Ordinance or duty, and you may ſee that three ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you look upon the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> you ſhall ſee there all the <hi>people of God,</hi> they practiſed it, I need not inſtance in any one place.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, you will eaſily grant, that if you
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:117675:81"/> look upon the times of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>dawning</hi> of it in <hi>Chriſts time,</hi> (for that was the dawning of the <hi>new Teſtament)</hi> there you ſee <hi>Chriſt prayed whole nights,</hi> and <hi>before day</hi> he was on the mountain <hi>ſeeking God;</hi> and there are many <hi>Parables,</hi> one in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other here, wherein he exhorts his diſciples to be <hi>earneſt</hi> with God, and though God as it were ſeem as if he had <hi>no minde</hi> otherwiſe to do it, yet by the very <hi>importunity of prayer</hi> (for that is the drift of that <hi>Parable</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. and of this) the Lord will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. Then come after to the times that the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> was fully ſet up; you ſee when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was gone to the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> there they <hi>prayed,</hi> and <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> on God <hi>continually,</hi> all thoſe Churches did <hi>call upon God,</hi> there is nothing more clear.</p>
            <p>Nay, thirdly, (for there is the main hint of it) in the <hi>laſt times,</hi> in <hi>theſe times,</hi> and in <hi>later</hi> times then theſe (though theſe be called the laſt times) the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious times that ſhall be juſt at the end of the world, the people of <hi>God</hi> will be a <hi>praying people</hi> in thoſe days. I will give you but one place, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. that is clear concerning the <hi>converſion of the Iews</hi> in the <hi>laſt</hi> times, <hi>that they ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn every family apart.</hi> Now the <hi>Iews</hi> are not yet come in, neither are thoſe <hi>glorious</hi> times yet come to the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon their coming, yet it is ſaid when they ſhall come in, <hi>praying</hi> ſhall be in ſuch requeſt in thoſe days that even the <hi>converſation</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> is called a pouring on them <hi>the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore ſay not now, the <hi>laſt times</hi> are come, and theſe are <hi>glorious</hi> times, and we can live <hi>immediatly</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:117675:81"/> upon God <hi>without</hi> Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, thoſe times are not come, and yet when that time is come, they ſhall have a <hi>ſpirit of grace and ſupplication to call upon God.</hi> And therefore I beſeech you, let not the devil ſteal away any of your Ordinances, for I tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again, he drives on a <hi>wonderful deſign</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you in that reſpect. And of all Ordinances, labour to keep <hi>Prayer:</hi> for caſt off <hi>Prayer,</hi> and caſt off <hi>Saintſhip;</hi> for to be a <hi>Saint,</hi> and to <hi>call on the name of the Lord with a true heart,</hi> are the ſame. I will call thee no longer a <hi>Saint</hi> then thou <hi>calleſt on God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notwithſtanding all <hi>pretences</hi> look to that. Some object, <hi>God knows</hi> our wants, and what need we <hi>pray?</hi> Saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Your heavenly Father knows what you have need of,</hi> and yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught them to <hi>pray.</hi> We muſt manifeſt our obedience notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>God</hi> will do one thing when we <hi>pray</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that is a fooliſh objection, becauſe we know not what is <hi>good</hi> for us, neither how to <hi>pray</hi> according to the minde of <hi>God:</hi> but if it be according to his <hi>minde,</hi> and for our <hi>good, God</hi> will not deny it to us.</p>
            <p>But the maine <hi>Engin</hi> that the devil hath to cheat us of this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> is, that there were times when there was neede of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and theſe <hi>beggerly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> (this is the language of ſome) theſe <hi>carnall Ordinances,</hi> it is true they were good in the <hi>times of the Apoſtles,</hi> and thoſe <hi>former</hi> times, but <hi>now</hi> glorious times are come for <hi>Saints</hi> to live <hi>immediately</hi> on <hi>God,</hi> and therefore there is no <hi>need</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>I told you that when the <hi>Iews ſhall be called</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:117675:82"/> there will be need of theſe <hi>Ordinances;</hi> and though as we grow <hi>more perfect</hi> in glory, ſo we have leſs need of them; therefore as we are more <hi>glorious,</hi> and have more of the <hi>Spirit of Glory</hi> in the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> then they had in the <hi>old,</hi> ſo we have <hi>fewer Ordinances</hi> then they; and when we ſhall come to heaven, when ſhe ſhall be <hi>full of glory,</hi> we ſhall have no <hi>Ordinances</hi> for ought I know: but yet we have <hi>infirmities,</hi> and the Lord knows what is beſt for us, and we have a great deal of <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>carnalneſs,</hi> and we ſhall have in a great meaſure till we be in heaven: therefore <hi>God</hi> in mercy affords us theſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> to deal with him, and to keep our <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> and to <hi>live in,</hi> and <hi>from him:</hi> Therefore I pray you without partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and prejudice weigh the <hi>Word of God,</hi> whether this be not the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and then take heed how the Devil <hi>cheat</hi> you of this <hi>bleſſed Ordinance;</hi> for truly I may ſay, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the root,</hi> to the root of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and if the Devil take away that, thou art no more a <hi>Saint,</hi> my life for thine, if thou once throw away <hi>calling on God.</hi> Therefore learn that word, and endeavor to keep up the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> and you that do not, but are grown into <hi>remiſneſs</hi> by the Opinions that are abroad concerning this <hi>duty,</hi> I beſeech you renew your care and diligence every one of you in publick and private to ſeek the Lord.</p>
            <p>And conſider with your ſelves whether there be not a greater <hi>remiſneſs</hi> on your ſpirits then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, did you not ſet your ſelves <hi>oftner</hi> and more <hi>earneſtly</hi> apart to <hi>ſeek</hi> God <hi>before,</hi> then you do
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117675:82"/> now? If it be ſo, in the name of God, ſay as <hi>David, O how ſweet is thy Word! by it thy ſervant is warned.</hi> Now this is the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of his <hi>Word</hi> that hath warned thee when thou wert going to undo thy ſelf, and to throw thy ſelf away: Therefore ſet thy ſelf to it, and let not the ſin of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>throwing away of Ordinances,</hi> make you <hi>remiſs</hi> in uſing them, either throw them away quite, or uſe them as the <hi>Ordinances of God,</hi> for the <hi>careleſs</hi> uſe of <hi>Ordinances</hi> is abominable to <hi>God.</hi>

            <p>For their <hi>perſons,</hi> that is, we do conceive that we do <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:117675:83"/> deal with God as he is <hi>my Father,</hi> as he is revealed to me in <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> ſo that if we could conceive that our <hi>perſons</hi> are <hi>fully juſtified,</hi> that all <hi>my weakneſſes</hi> thoughout the day, or week, or year do not make me <hi>according to his Law</hi> one jot more <hi>unjuſt</hi> nor all my <hi>good</hi> doth not make me more <hi>juſt,</hi> for Chriſt Jeſus his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> doth that wholly, therefore my perſon for ever is freed from the power of the Law, and if I ſin, <hi>grace</hi> may call me to <hi>account</hi> for it, and <hi>whip</hi> and <hi>ſcourge</hi> me with his <hi>Ferula:</hi> but for the <hi>Law,</hi> what have I to do with that? what have I to do with a husband that is <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>buried?</hi> what have I to do with the <hi>Covenant of works</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> and <hi>cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore get your perſons <hi>clear of the Law;</hi> for that is it that <hi>evidenceth</hi> many times that you are not, becauſe when you ſin againſt God, then there ariſeth <hi>ſtorms within</hi> you that were once <hi>without</hi> you, on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that <hi>blackneſs</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> then you fear you are <hi>hypocrites,</hi> then you finde <hi>wrath</hi> in your <hi>conſciences:</hi> as oft as you finde wrath, (that is the work of the Law, for the <hi>Law worketh wrath)</hi> it ſhews clearly that your perſons are not quite freed from the <hi>Law,</hi> for though there ſhould be <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and more kindly, and abundant <hi>ſorrow</hi> then ever you felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and care, and other things, yet even that <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>horror,</hi> and <hi>hardneſs</hi> of <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>riſings</hi> of <hi>ſpirit</hi> againſt God, will teſtifie that in ſome meaſure your <hi>perſons</hi> are <hi>under the Law.</hi>

               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:117675:84"/> the Law, for as one ſaith, as our <hi>perſons are juſtified fully by Chriſt,</hi> ſo are our <hi>actions;</hi> that is, whatſoever <hi>action</hi> I do, or <hi>commit,</hi> however that <hi>action</hi> may not be <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God according to <hi>Grace</hi> or the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it may not be an <hi>acceptable ſacrifice,</hi> as all our <hi>actions</hi> ſhould be, yet notwithſtanding we ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that our <hi>actions</hi> are to be <hi>ſquared</hi> and <hi>meaſured</hi> according to the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> which is the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>works.</hi> As for Inſtance, when a man is <hi>under the Law,</hi> whoſe <hi>actions are under the Law,</hi> he labors all the day long to pleaſe God, to ſerve, and obey him, but if he fail but once or twice that day in his <hi>duty,</hi> there is ſome <hi>confuſion</hi> whiſpered in his ſoul that all is loſt, there is more <hi>trouble</hi> for that one <hi>fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> then he hath <hi>comfort</hi> for all that he hath done that day; that is juſt the <hi>Law,</hi> for the <hi>Law</hi> ſaith, if <hi>he fail in one he is guilty of all.</hi> Now if a man be under <hi>grace,</hi> he rejoyceth in his <hi>ſincere indeavor</hi> to honor God, and he rejoyceth in the <hi>paſſages</hi> of that day, that he hath had <hi>communion</hi> with God, and where there is <hi>weakneſs,</hi> there would be a ſweet, clear <hi>mourning</hi> for it in reference to God as a <hi>Father,</hi> and not to have the <hi>heart eſtranged</hi> from God, and <hi>ſtraitned.</hi> Our <hi>actions</hi> in a great meaſure are <hi>under the Law.</hi> Our <hi>actions</hi> are <hi>freed from the Law</hi> in this life, but we know not our <hi>freedom.</hi> They are <hi>freed</hi> thus, all ariſe either from <hi>fleſh</hi> or <hi>ſpirit;</hi> for thoſe are the two <hi>beginnings,</hi> the two firſt <hi>beeings</hi> of all. Now thoſe of the <hi>fleſh</hi> (for a Chriſtian may do an <hi>action</hi> that is purely <hi>fleſh,</hi> that hath no good in it, then) that is a ſin, Chriſt Jeſus hath done it away. Now if it be an <hi>action</hi> that ariſeth from his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> that flows
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:117675:84"/> from the principle of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> that is in him, the Lord <hi>accepts</hi> of it, that is done already, if he were able to do it, yet it comes too late; but onely he doth it as the honeſt upright indeavor of a <hi>loving childe</hi> to a <hi>dear father.</hi> So, could we meaſure our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> according to that <hi>rule,</hi> our lives would be more <hi>holy,</hi> and more <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>comfortable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, our <hi>afflictions,</hi> or <hi>ſufferings,</hi> (it were well <note place="margin">3 Relating to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> if we could get out from under the laſh of the <hi>Law</hi> in all theſe) there we are deeply under it; as ſoon as ever we are <hi>whipped,</hi> then we ſay, God hath <hi>found me out,</hi> and it is true, God may whip me for it, becauſe I will not take <hi>notice</hi> of it: though God will not hide his <hi>countenance,</hi> and his <hi>ſmiles</hi> from his childe, one jot further then he muſt needs do it for fear of <hi>cockering</hi> him: therefore I know if God <hi>frown, and hide his face,</hi> that God loves me, and he would ſhew it: but I have a <hi>baſe heart,</hi> that at ſuch times as that would like ſome <hi>ſin,</hi> and be <hi>wanton,</hi> otherwiſe, God hath no delight to <hi>hide his face</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now all my <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>ſufferings,</hi> I am not to look on them <hi>under the Law,</hi> that is, as though God in reference to theſe had a purpoſe to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> himſelf, and his <hi>vengeance,</hi> and to let his <hi>wrath</hi> fall upon me, (that is clearly to fruſtrate the death of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> but I am to look on that as <hi>fully ſatisfied,</hi> and <hi>done</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and God is more faithful then to be paid <hi>twice:</hi> but I am to look upon all my <hi>afflictions,</hi> as proceeding from the <hi>love</hi> of a <hi>dear father,</hi> and I can take notice of many <hi>ſins</hi> that <hi>diſpleaſe him,</hi> and he hath many <hi>Goſpel-</hi>ends to do me <hi>good:</hi> therefore in <hi>afflictions</hi> I admit not one <hi>hard</hi> thought of God, but
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:117675:85"/> 
               <hi>love</hi> him <hi>more</hi> for his favor in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> If we ſee <hi>afflictions</hi> under <hi>grace</hi> aright, then <hi>afflictions</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly kindle <hi>love</hi> to God, and <hi>increaſe</hi> our <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with <hi>him;</hi> and whereas they make us <hi>run from God,</hi> they would make us <hi>run to him,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> but we are <hi>under the Law,</hi> and that makes our <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> to be a <hi>burthen.</hi> O that the Lord would help us to get clear of it, that every one would labour to get his ſpirit, his <hi>perſon,</hi> his <hi>actions,</hi> and his <hi>corrections,</hi> and all clear of that, and dead to that.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>But ye are under grace.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace</hi> in this place (as I conceive) hath a very large extent, and is not taken onely for that <hi>favor of God,</hi> as it is uſually in Scripture, but there is ſomething meant by it, that ſhall be equivalent (in all reſpects to a Chriſtian) to the <hi>Law, for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> they are oppoſites.</p>
            <p>Now what that is that is meant by it, I conceive, and can give divers Scriptures alſo if I had time, that by <hi>Grace</hi> here is meant the <hi>whole Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi> Indeed the ſubſtance of the <hi>Law</hi> is contained in it; for the <hi>ſubſtance of the Law</hi> is one and the ſame for ever. I ſay the whole <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> that is called <hi>Grace;</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>gracious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> it is a Doctrine full of <hi>Grace.</hi> The <hi>ſtream,</hi> and the <hi>maine</hi> thing of our <hi>Preaching,</hi> is, or ſhould be <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> the <hi>love of God,</hi> and the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</hi> If it be taken for the whole <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>The grace of God hath appeared to all men, teaching us to deny ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live holily and ſoberly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, <hi>the</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:117675:85"/> 
               <hi>Doctrine of Grace</hi> or the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. <hi>I beſeech you receive not the grace of God in vain,</hi> that is, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which hath in it <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and the like. <hi>Grace</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> are oppoſites, as we ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>The Law came by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but grace and truth came by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>grace</hi> in this place is to be underſtood in a large ſenſe.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>You are under grace,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Saints</hi> do not conſider what <hi>ſtrength</hi> they have, If thou didſt conſider what <hi>ſtrength</hi> thou haſt in thee, thou wouldeſt not be <hi>afraid</hi> to hear a <hi>Croſs,</hi> thou wouldſt not be <hi>diſcouraged</hi> to <hi>attempt</hi> any <hi>work</hi> for God, thou wouldeſt not be <hi>diſmaied</hi> at the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of men, no, nor at the <hi>temptations</hi> of the <hi>devil:</hi> there is ſuch an <hi>exceeding great and mighty power</hi> that <hi>works in them that believe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If a Chriſtian would obſerve his <hi>way,</hi> and obſerve his <hi>leader,</hi> a Chriſtian might eaſily finde when he is <hi>in,</hi> and when he is <hi>out;</hi> for truly, if a man would ask himſelf, Why did I <hi>miſs the will of God</hi> ſo often, ſince I have ſuch a <hi>Teacher</hi> promiſed me, and <hi>given</hi> me by Chriſt? he muſt needs ſay, that oftentimes I did not <hi>obſerve</hi> him, I did not <hi>hearken</hi> to him, I <hi>hearkened</hi> only to men, and not to the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> And ſo he would
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:117675:89"/> eaſily finde, when he began to give over <hi>harkning</hi> where he <hi>left</hi> the <hi>teaching of the Spirit;</hi> for in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion a <hi>Saint</hi> follows the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> with a kinde of <hi>ſagacity</hi> (if I may compare it with reverence) juſt as we ſee the <hi>Dog</hi> follow the <hi>Hare:</hi> there is ſomething in Nature that the <hi>Dog</hi> knows which way the <hi>Hare</hi> went, when a wiſer creature knows not: ſo, there is ſomething in a <hi>poor Saint,</hi> that when all the <hi>wiſe men</hi> in the <hi>world</hi> know not which <hi>way</hi> God went, a <hi>Saint</hi> can tell: Onely the <hi>Dog</hi> may hunt upon a <hi>cold ſent,</hi> and think the <hi>Hare</hi> went that way, and it grows <hi>colder</hi> and <hi>colder,</hi> and he miſſeth: So a <hi>Saint</hi> ſhall finde when he <hi>miſſeth</hi> the <hi>will of God,</hi> that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath not left him, unleſs it be very <hi>rare,</hi> as the Spirit <hi>left</hi> Chriſt to be <hi>tempted in the wilderneſs,</hi> ſo he may leave thee to pull down thy <hi>pride,</hi> and to <hi>humble</hi> thee, Iſay, that is <hi>rare:</hi> but ordinarily, the Spirit <hi>leaves not thee,</hi> but thou letteſt goe thy <hi>leader,</hi> and thou goeſt all the while on a <hi>cold ſent.</hi> A <hi>Saint,</hi> though he headlong follows this, or that <hi>conceit,</hi> yet notwithſtanding he may know when he comes to look upon himſelf; ſurely I went upon a <hi>cold ſent</hi> in thoſe things: though I followed them <hi>headlong,</hi> and <hi>giddily,</hi> it was not of the Spirit, it was not the ſame <hi>teaching</hi> that I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily.

            <p>That which I chiefly intended to ſhew you, was <note place="margin">The power of the Spirit ſet out in four things.</note> to give you a few inſtances, that you may have a little light, to ſee the <hi>exceeding greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>power of the Spirit working</hi> in you. I ſhall not ſhew in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, nor in many, as I might, but onely in a few. I will inſtance in theſe three or four things. As firſt, <note place="margin">1. In dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a world of prayers to us.</note> that you may ſee the greatneſs of his power, what a <hi>world of prayers doth the Spirit of God put into thy heart, that thou art never able to utter with thy mouth?</hi> All the <hi>wiſdom</hi> in the <hi>world</hi> cannot make one <hi>ſpiritual pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition;</hi> we may make <hi>forms of Prayer;</hi> but now the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> that <hi>knoweth the minde of God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>that maketh prayers according to the will of God, and he prayes with ſighs and groans unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> I ſpeak to them that <hi>know</hi> the <hi>working</hi> of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> how many thouſand <hi>prayers</hi> doth <hi>God put</hi> into thy <hi>heart</hi> that it is impoſſible for thee to <hi>utter</hi> with thy mouth? Thou canſt not ſpeak to God <hi>one peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of fourty that the <hi>Spirit</hi> puts into thy heart. That ſome conceive to be the meaning of that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The Spirit prays with ſighes unutterable,</hi> not becauſe of our <hi>weakneſs,</hi> but becauſe of their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and they are ſo <hi>numerous,</hi> they are ſo <hi>many,</hi> that when a poor <hi>Saint</hi> goes to <hi>pray,</hi> one petition <hi>ſtops</hi> another, and throngs it out that he cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould hear only thoſe <hi>prayers</hi> that thou makeſt with thy <hi>mouth,</hi> thou wouldeſt be but a poor man, but the Lord reſpects the <hi>prayers of the heart:</hi> Therefore I ſay, to have <hi>power</hi> to make one <hi>prayer,</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:117675:90"/> and to have ſuch <hi>innumerable ſighes</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> in the ſoul too, it muſt be an <hi>exceeding great</hi> power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider this, how much the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <note place="margin">2. In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying us when we pray not.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>for</hi> thee, and <hi>in</hi> thee, that thou never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt for, nor never couldeſt <hi>pray</hi> for, no, not ſo much as in <hi>heart.</hi> If the Lord did anſwer all the <hi>prayers of heart</hi> and <hi>tongue,</hi> that we make throughout all the year, a man would think that were a great matter; but ſurely they are ſo <hi>few,</hi> conſidering our <hi>wants,</hi> and they are ſo <hi>confuſed</hi> and <hi>blinde,</hi> that I am confident, if God ſhould deal with thy ſoul and mine, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our <hi>prayers</hi> all the year, we ſhould be <hi>miſerable creatures</hi> all our lives. God <hi>exerciſeth</hi> us to <hi>pray,</hi> and many of them he anſwers in their kinde, and he is pleaſed with our <hi>obedience</hi> in every thing: but ſurely, God hath a <hi>higher rule</hi> of doing us good, and the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> works in a more <hi>methodicall,</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> way, then we can <hi>pray.</hi> I have ſometimes wondred that God hath made <hi>promiſes</hi> to anſwer many <hi>prayers</hi> that we make; but I wonder more that God ſhould grant things that we <hi>pray</hi> not for. This is the exceeding greatneſs of his power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider the <hi>exceeding greatneſs</hi> of his <note place="margin">3. By teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> power in this reſpect, in his <hi>teaching,</hi> how the Spirit of God <hi>teacheth</hi> his <hi>people</hi> and <hi>ſervants,</hi> he teacheth them above what they are <hi>taught outwardly</hi> by men. As thus, Caſt with thy ſelf, ſuppoſe thou hadſt every <hi>Sermon</hi> that thou haſt <hi>heard</hi> in thy life, and every <hi>Lecture</hi> that thou haſt <hi>heard</hi> on the <hi>week</hi> days, and on the <hi>Lords</hi> day, that thou hadſt them in <hi>order</hi> and <hi>method,</hi> ſuppoſe they were <hi>written</hi> in thy <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>freſh</hi> in thy <hi>memory,</hi> that thou didſt <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:117675:90"/> and <hi>remember</hi> every <hi>Sermon</hi> that thou haſt heard (which no man doth) a man would think ſuch a one to be a very <hi>knowing</hi> man. Truly if thou hadſt it ſo, thou mighteſt be a <hi>miſerable, confuſed, blinde</hi> man for all that, for all that ever thou haſt <hi>heard</hi> preached, thou mighteſt be a <hi>blinde</hi> creature: for alas! our <hi>teaching</hi> comes with ſo much <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>droſs</hi> with it, and one <hi>ſaith,</hi> and another <hi>unſaith;</hi> and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in a <hi>natural</hi> way we ſhall never be made <hi>knowing</hi> men by all <hi>outward teaching</hi> in the world. But now the Spirit of God comes in, and he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed indeed to make uſe of it, that we ſhall <hi>teach out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly;</hi> but alas! the Spirit of God reads ſuch a <hi>Lecture</hi> in the heart of a <hi>Saint,</hi> and <hi>clears</hi> things, and <hi>orders</hi> things, and <hi>aſſures</hi> things, and <hi>ſettles</hi> things that are right, and <hi>diſcovers</hi> things that are not, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth,</hi> and <hi>ſweetens,</hi> and <hi>quickens</hi> them, that it may be a man in hearing one Sermon of an hour long, may be <hi>taught</hi> more, then another man in hearing Sermons ſeven years together. This is the <hi>exceeding greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> that truly (beloved) I have often thought with my ſelf (I ſpeak not to <hi>diſparage</hi> our <hi>teaching,</hi> and your <hi>hearing,</hi> but) our coming to <hi>teach,</hi> and you to <hi>hear,</hi> it is as your ſending your little children to School, to keep their cloaths clean, and to keep them from play, they learn nothing (in a manner) for your money, onely they are obedient to their <hi>Parents,</hi> and are <hi>quiet,</hi> and are in the School where <hi>teaching</hi> is. So you come to <hi>hear,</hi> and we to <hi>teach;</hi> but all our teaching in a manner is by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> Therefore it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing to ſee how quickly the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> will
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:117675:91"/> make a Schollar ripe; how in a quarter of a year, nay, in a moneth almoſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God will fill him with all <hi>ſpirituall learning,</hi> whereas the beſt <hi>preacher</hi> in the world, let him Preach <hi>conciſely</hi> and <hi>exactly</hi> in a <hi>natural</hi> way, he ſhall not <hi>teach</hi> him the tenth part: Nay, we <hi>reach</hi> you, we <hi>preach</hi> it may be four or five Sermons, and we <hi>open</hi> it as well we can, poor <hi>earthen creatures,</hi> and when we come to look on it a quarter of a year after, we finde that thoſe <hi>notions</hi> that it may be were ſo <hi>confuſed</hi> and poor while we were <hi>teaching</hi> you, that there is a glorious <hi>piece</hi> made in your ſouls, by the Spirit of God, though our <hi>Notes</hi> when they were done, were ſcarce worth the <hi>burning,</hi> we are ſo poor and frail in <hi>teaching,</hi> and you in your outward <hi>hearing,</hi> therefore there is an exceeding great <hi>power that works in you that believe.</hi>

We have a ſaying, It holds true, I gainſay it not in a ſort, that a man in <hi>converſion</hi> is <hi>paſſive,</hi> and afterwards he is <hi>active,</hi> that is, God in a mans <hi>converſion</hi> works on a man as a <hi>dead creature,</hi> only he is <hi>rational,</hi> but he <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> and <hi>works</hi> not with <hi>God,</hi> but when he is <hi>converted,</hi> then a man hath a <hi>principle of life. God</hi> works, and <hi>man</hi> works, <hi>man</hi> works with <hi>God,</hi> and it is a true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, we were then <hi>paſsive,</hi> now we are <hi>active.</hi> But in reſpect of the <hi>principle,</hi> by which we <hi>move,</hi> and <hi>walk:</hi> truely a Chriſtian may ſay, I am altogether
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:117675:91"/> 
               <hi>paſsive</hi> in a manner in all that I do. God carries a mans <hi>tongue</hi> to ſpeak, and his <hi>hands</hi> to work, and his <hi>feet</hi> to walk, God <hi>carries</hi> a man in good many times, and <hi>glorifies</hi> himſelf many times, and a man <hi>knows not</hi> how in the world he comes to do it, or <hi>why</hi> he did it, or <hi>how he came about it;</hi> ſo God doth many glorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things by us, and we are not <hi>aware,</hi> This is the <hi>Lord,</hi> this is the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his <hi>power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God in ſome <hi>actions,</hi> he either <hi>carries</hi> a man, and doth his work by a man, <hi>without</hi> a man (as it were) or elſe he doth it <hi>above</hi> him. There is no <hi>good</hi> almoſt that thou <hi>doeſt,</hi> but thou ſhalt clearly ſee that it is <hi>above</hi> thee, that it is <hi>God,</hi> thou wert never able to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> or to <hi>do</hi> or to <hi>go</hi> through any ſuch thing, but <hi>the Lord went through with it.</hi> It may be ſome of you underſtand not what it is to do a thing <hi>without</hi> you, it is too ſpiritual; but there are Chriſtians that may, and can ſay, God did it <hi>without</hi> me, I was as a <hi>block,</hi> I <hi>know</hi> not how, I was ſcarce active with God, <hi>God</hi> did all. O <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> is that <hi>power,</hi> look which way you will, what that <hi>power</hi> is in <hi>changing</hi> thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in <hi>deſtroying</hi> old <hi>Adam,</hi> what that power is in <hi>reſiſting</hi> temptations, what that power is in <hi>wreſtling,</hi> and <hi>prevailing</hi> with God, what that power is to <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> thee in the wicked world, and to <hi>preſerve</hi> thee to the laſt day. Conſider it every way: it is <hi>great, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous, glorious,</hi> and <hi>mighty,</hi> and <hi>exceeding mighty</hi> is that <hi>power</hi> that <hi>works in them that believe,</hi> even the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit is called <hi>power,</hi> Power it ſelf (as it were) not that I deny the <hi>perſon of the Spirit</hi> thereby, as if the <hi>Spirit</hi> were nothing but the <hi>energy</hi> or <hi>working</hi> of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:117675:92"/> God, that is not the meaning; but he is called <hi>power,</hi> becauſe (as it were) he is nothing but <hi>power,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth, he doth <hi>powerfully,</hi> and <hi>gloriouſly,</hi> and <hi>effectually;</hi> Angels work in <hi>little, common, outward</hi> things; marke the difference between the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of Angels. The Angels are <hi>miniſtring ſpirits</hi> ſent out to <hi>wait</hi> upon the <hi>Saints.</hi> How do Angels work for us? Angels make not <hi>prayers</hi> in us, Angels never ſubdue one ſin in me, they can never bring <hi>peace</hi> to my conſcience, and ſoul; Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe not in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things, but in <hi>outward</hi> things; Angels <hi>keep thee that thou daſh not thy foot againſt a ſtone,</hi> they <hi>keep</hi> thee from breaking thy neck, they keep fire from thine houſe; but <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things are done by the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> the <hi>exceeding greatneſs</hi> of power is by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Therefore conſider of this word, be not ſuch <hi>poor, low-hearted</hi> creatures, to be afraid of every ill, and to be <hi>diſcouraged</hi> from going about any good thing. I ſay, conſider the <hi>power</hi> that dwels in you, and indeavor to give glory to God, to magnify the bleſſed Spirit, that <hi>works</hi> in you, to <hi>admire</hi> it, for the more you <hi>admire</hi> the Spirit, the more <hi>vile</hi> you will be in your ſelves, and the <hi>viler</hi> you are in your ſelves that you attribute all to the Spirit, the more glory God ſhall have, and then things will be as they ſhould be, in the beſt <hi>order</hi> for God and man.</p>

So you may ſay, when you ſee <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Whoremongers,</hi> and <hi>Extortioners,</hi> if the devil tempt you in your hearts, and ſay, <hi>Why doſt not thou do ſo?</hi> why doſt not thou <hi>get money</hi> as yonder man doth? or labor to be <hi>great in the world?</hi> O, ſay, do the <hi>ſons of God</hi> uſe to do ſo? to <hi>cozen,</hi> and <hi>cheat,</hi> and be <hi>drunk,</hi> and <hi>lie?</hi> If the <hi>Saints</hi> did ſo, then it were another thing, but ſhall I that am a <hi>Prince,</hi> that am a <hi>ſon of God,</hi> ſhall I be a <hi>Scullion,</hi> and <hi>wallow</hi> in the dirt?

            <p>There is one thing more which is here laid down in this Scripture that we muſt indeavor to do, though when I ſpeak of doing, when we teach you any <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Goſpel</hi> duty, you muſt underſtand it in a <hi>Goſpel</hi> way; not as though (I ſay) we <hi>can do</hi> this or that, but we through the grace of Chriſt <hi>may do</hi> any thing that is <hi>commanded</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Therefore go not home, and ſay, we are <hi>dead,</hi> and can do nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To what end are all theſe <hi>precepts</hi> laid on us, but that we by the <hi>power of the holy Ghoſt</hi> may do them?

            <p>The Apoſtle doth here, as it is uſually his manner, when he <hi>exhorts</hi> to any thing, he tells them not, Do this, or you ſhall be <hi>damned,</hi> do this or elſe you are <hi>hypocrites,</hi> or elſe the <hi>curſe</hi> of God will fall on you: for he carries that clearly in all his Epiſtles that there is no <hi>damnation</hi> to them that are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>you are are not appointed unto wrath,</hi> ſaith he, but he preſſeth them unto it out of the <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> and <hi>dearneſs</hi> of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things that they apprehended.

            <p>You will not be right till you come to this, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>I am the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> ſaith he; and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>I am the greateſt of all ſinners;</hi> you will never be in a right frame, in a <hi>Goſpel</hi> frame to <hi>love your brethren,</hi> till when you look on <hi>ſinners,</hi> you account your ſelves the <hi>greateſt,</hi> and when you look on <hi>Saints,</hi> you reckon your ſelves the <hi>leaſt.</hi> Therefore this is a plain, ſhort Leſſon.

            <p>This is that that breeds <hi>endleſs quarrels</hi> (for they are here put together, <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Vain glory,</hi> and the like) for thou wilt be alway like the <hi>Salamander</hi> feeding upon ſome <hi>quarrel,</hi> for every man naturally hath ſome one thing that he <hi>feeds</hi> on principally; children feed on one cate more then another, and ſo do men, ſome upon <hi>Husbandry,</hi> ſome upon <hi>Navigation,</hi> ſome upon <hi>Policy,</hi> every one upon one thing or other.

            <p>I cannot go over all the particulars, but if you read <note place="margin">All things amiable to a man rightly built upon Chriſt.</note> them over, you ſhall ſee that there is no <hi>object</hi> but what is throughly <hi>amiable,</hi> and that is the onely thing I would commend to you. Let him be a man that is <hi>rightly laid</hi> upon Jeſus Chriſt, and hath the <hi>right knowledg</hi> of him according to the Goſpel, by his <hi>holy Spirit:</hi> I do not ſay that there is a <hi>little,</hi> but there is <hi>nothing</hi> that he can conceive or imagine, but it is <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> to him, as</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:117675:101"/> 
               <hi>providing them</hi> for him, and he <hi>taſts</hi> the <hi>love of God</hi> in <hi>them.</hi> If he look on <hi>afflictions,</hi> he ſees them as <hi>ſweet, wiſe,</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonable corrections</hi> from his heavenly <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to bring him nearer to him. If he look on <hi>ſin,</hi> as ſin is the <hi>tranſgreſsion</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> he ſees all <hi>forgiven</hi> by the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> that is in Chriſt, and all <hi>nailed</hi> to his <hi>Croſs,</hi> and he knows that ſin in him ſhall <hi>work for the beſt,</hi> that it may make him <hi>prize the grace of God</hi> more, and come nearer to God. If he look on <hi>perſecution,</hi> and the <hi>plotting</hi> of wicked people againſt the Church; a <hi>Saint</hi> that is rightly ſet in the <hi>new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> he ſees nothing but what is <hi>beautiful,</hi> and <hi>amiable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not but that there are <hi>objects</hi> that in themſelves are not <hi>amiable;</hi> as <hi>ſin</hi> is not <hi>amiable</hi> in it ſelf <hi>properly</hi> conſidered, neither is <hi>affliction,</hi> but he hath ſuch a <hi>glaſs,</hi> the Lord caſts ſuch a <hi>light</hi> in him through which he ſees every thing, the <hi>light</hi> of the Goſpel, through the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> that there is nothing but <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>comfort.</hi> That is the reaſon that the Apoſtle commands, which is a ſtrange command, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the midſt of afflictions, rejoyce when ye fall into divers temptations. And rejoyce, and again rejoyce, Phil.</hi> 4.

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:117675:102"/> 
               <hi>evermore.</hi> I do not know whether you yet fully <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> it: the Lord <hi>teach</hi> you, that you may know what is the hope of you <hi>calling,</hi> what a <hi>glorious condition</hi> God hath called you to.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with three or four words of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to you from this Leſſon, that every <hi>object</hi> that a <hi>Saint</hi> that is in the <hi>new Ieruſalem</hi> can <hi>behold,</hi> is altogether <hi>amiable.</hi> The uſes are here mentioned in the Chapter before.</p>
            <p>Then in the firſt place learn not to <hi>faint</hi> under <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Uſe Not to faint in afflictions.</note> for that is the reaſon the Apoſtle brings this in, do not ſo much ſtrive, or ſtruggle how to get out of <hi>afflictions,</hi> as to get more <hi>Goſpel light</hi> to ſee <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> for that is all one, nay, better then the other. Therefore if the Lord do but give you a little Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve, that is, his <hi>Spirit</hi> to look on them, you ſhall ſee no <hi>gall,</hi> nor <hi>taſte,</hi> nor ſee any <hi>miſery</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> in them at all. That is the Uſe that is here ſpoken of. Therefore what ever thy <hi>afflictions</hi> be, labor to underſtand <hi>rightly</hi> their <hi>nature,</hi> and thy <hi>ſtation</hi> in the <hi>new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and no doubt but thou ſhalt bear them through.</p>
            <p>Another Uſe that the Apoſtle teacheth us is this, <note place="margin">2. Not to undervalue the glorious condition of Saintſhip.</note> and me thinks in my apprehenſion it is a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable word, <hi>Beware leaſt there be any fornicator, or prophane perſon among you, as</hi> Eſau, <hi>that for one morſel of meat ſold his Birthright: for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we are not come to the Mount that might be touched.</hi> I apprehend the meaning to be this, that this being ſo, the eſtate of a <hi>Saint</hi> being ſo <hi>glorious,</hi> then <hi>beware</hi> you that are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> leaſt any of you be ſo <hi>prophane</hi> as to <hi>ſell your birth-right,</hi> that is, all your <hi>glorious priviledges,</hi> and

               </hi> that is, that you do not relinquiſh baſely theſe mercies, to <hi>forſake your own mercies,</hi> as <hi>Ionah</hi> ſaith, to imbrace ſome <hi>luſt</hi> or other, either to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>world,</hi> or to fall to <hi>wantonneſs,</hi> or <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> or any thing elſe; and ſo to bargain as <hi>Eſau,</hi> that ſold all his <hi>bleſſed title</hi> in the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> and in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for a <hi>meſs of pottage:</hi> Beware of that <hi>prophaneneſs,</hi> for <hi>prophaneneſs</hi> is not onely when men <hi>commit groſs</hi> evils (as we ſay) but this is a <hi>prophane</hi> man, though he be a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> and walk <hi>civilly,</hi> that (though but in his <hi>heart)</hi> is willing to <hi>exchange</hi> the <hi>bleſſed eſtate</hi> that God hath called him to for the <hi>beſt happineſs</hi> in the world. There are many <hi>prophane,</hi> men that are not <hi>whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>drunkards,</hi> but are ready every day if the devil come to <hi>cheapen</hi> to give up their <hi>birthright</hi> for a <hi>meſs of pottage.</hi> Take heed you <hi>ſell</hi> it not, if you did underſtand it rightly, you would not ſell it for ten thouſand worlds, that <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath called you to.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:117675:103"/> the Lord to deliver you from a <hi>prophane</hi> heart.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is another Uſe that the Apoſtle <note place="margin">3. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage weaklings.</note> makes of it, therefore this ſhould <hi>encourage</hi> poor, weak Profeſſors, that are every day ready to faint, <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, and make ſtrait ſteps to your pathes, leaſt that which is lame go out of the way.</hi> The meaning is <hi>poor</hi> ſouls that are beaten out (as it were) as a <hi>ſhip</hi> in the ſea, all the week with <hi>temptations,</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>injuries,</hi> and <hi>reproaches,</hi> and <hi>threatnings,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions,</hi> that their hands almoſt <hi>fall,</hi> that they are ready to ſay as <hi>David, I have waſhed my hands in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie in vain.</hi> This is the way to keep up thy ſpirit: Labor, as <hi>Paul</hi> prays, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>to know the riches of thy calling,</hi> to underſtand the <hi>glorious</hi> condition that God hath called thee to here. I ſpeak not of that in <hi>heaven</hi> hereafter, but the glorious eſtate <hi>here,</hi> if thou hadſt <hi>eyes</hi> to ſee it, and a <hi>heart</hi> to judg of it, then you would not be ſo <hi>tormented</hi> all the week long with a few <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> and ſo be ready to give up, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, I <hi>ſhall one day periſh by the hands of</hi> Saul, ſo, I ſhall one of theſe ſhort days prove an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> a <hi>prophane man,</hi> I am ſo haunted with <hi>temptations,</hi> and ſo followed with <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>luſts.</hi> No, beloved, ſtudy that bleſſed <hi>eſtate,</hi> what <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> what the <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ieruſalem</hi> is, that <hi>City of the living God;</hi> that God hath called you to, and that will <hi>ſupport</hi> thee.</p>
            <p>Then, that I may conclude, Laſtly, this is the uſe <note place="margin">4. To ſtudy peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> the Apoſtle would have us make of it, to <hi>follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee ſee God.</hi> That is, if you do underſtand aright your
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:117675:103"/> 
               <hi>ſpiritual condition,</hi> the <hi>happineſs</hi> of it, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, then ſurely you will be <hi>peaceable</hi> people, you will be at <hi>peace</hi> with all men; for this is a general truth to me, that our <hi>frowardneſs</hi> doth generally ariſe from ſome <hi>diſtemper</hi> of our own ſouls within, I mean, when a man ſees that <hi>God is angry</hi> with him, he is <hi>angry</hi> with others: that is certain alway, if God look <hi>ſtrangely</hi> upon him, he will look <hi>ſtrangely</hi> upon others, if God <hi>quarrel</hi> with him, he will <hi>quarrel</hi> with others: but if God <hi>ſmile</hi> upon the ſoul, and <hi>ſhed his love into the heart,</hi> and <hi>ſet his love upon him,</hi> he will not be <hi>angry</hi> with any that are without (I mean with a <hi>carnal anger)</hi> that is the reaſon that when <hi>a mans ways pleaſe God, the ſtones of the ſtreet ſhall be at peace with him.</hi> Did you ever ſee the <hi>ſtones</hi> of the <hi>ſtreet</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with you? but the meaning is, when a mans ways are <hi>croſs</hi> with God, and he hath a <hi>guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> a <hi>guilty ſoul</hi> hath no true <hi>peace,</hi> he is ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to <hi>fall out</hi> with the <hi>ſtones</hi> in the <hi>ſtreet,</hi> he <hi>quarrels</hi> with his <hi>ſervant,</hi> with his <hi>horſe,</hi> with every thing, becauſe he hath an unquiet ſpirit within, <hi>when a man pleaſeth God, the ſtones ſhall be at peace with him,</hi> that is, he ſhall be at <hi>peace</hi> with every thing. Why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is an <hi>infinite, unſpeakable</hi> quiet in his own ſoul.</p>
            <p>That is the reaſon we have ſo many <hi>Profeſſors</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us that are ſo <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> to others, ſome they call <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and ſome <hi>Independents,</hi> and divers other <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> you may pick them out in every <hi>Congregation</hi> that are ſo <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> to others, if they <hi>croſs</hi> them, or <hi>diſſent</hi> from them never ſo little What is the reaſon? becauſe there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:117675:104"/> of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> that have <hi>one foot</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> they walk by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> they have patched a <hi>feined rotten</hi> peace in them with God in Chriſt, and ſo many times there is <hi>blackneſs</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi> within, therefore they are ready to <hi>wrangle</hi> and <hi>quarrel</hi> with others without.</p>
            <p>But God hath called us to <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> where is that? where the <hi>ſwords are turned into Pruning hooks, and the ſpeares into Ploughſhares, ſighing</hi> and <hi>ſorrow is gone away, and there is no ravenous beaſt there,</hi> meaning the glorious eſtate of the <hi>Saints</hi> in the purity of the <hi>light of the Goſpel;</hi> all our <hi>ravenous</hi> ſpirits ſhall be taken away, for it is impoſſible, that ſoul that hath the <hi>love of God ſhed into it,</hi> and the <hi>peace of God rightly</hi> planted in it, it is impoſſible but that ſoul ſhould be <hi>milde,</hi> and <hi>calm,</hi> and <hi>meek,</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> and <hi>loving,</hi> and <hi>courteous</hi> to all, and be at <hi>peace</hi> with all, and <hi>peaceable</hi> to all.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>holineſs, Follow holineſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, this would make you <hi>holy,</hi> if you did underſtand your <hi>condition</hi> rightly: O, if you were <hi>perſwaded</hi> that God did <hi>love you from eteruity,</hi> and that his Son did <hi>die for you,</hi> and that you and he are as really <hi>one</hi> as he is <hi>one</hi> with his <hi>Father,</hi> and that all the treaſures that are in Chriſt are yours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this would inevitably work in us a <hi>holy frame</hi> of <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle uſually calls on us to be <hi>holy</hi> from ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of the Spirit</hi> do this and that, and leave that and the other evil. That is the reaſon we are <hi>lame</hi> in <hi>holineſs,</hi> becauſe our <hi>principles</hi> are ſo <hi>confounded,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> is not <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> and <hi>rightly,</hi> and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:117675:104"/> 
               <hi>orderly,</hi> and <hi>diſtinctly</hi> planted in us, or elſe we would be more <hi>holy,</hi> and look on <hi>ſin</hi> in another manner then ever, and hate the <hi>appearance</hi> of it, and <hi>cleave to that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the Leſſons that I thought of from this Scripture. Deſire God to inlarge them when you come home, for Truths uſe to breed in the ſoul. Therefore the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is compared to a <hi>Bird,</hi> the Spirit <hi>ſate on the waters,</hi> as the Bird doth on the <hi>neſt to hatch her yong.</hi> The Spirit of God (with reverence) will <hi>hatch</hi> ſuch truths as this in the <hi>hearts</hi> of his children, that though it be <hi>confuſed,</hi> and <hi>rude</hi> in the beginning, yet the Lord by his holy Spirit may break it out to a <hi>glorious,</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> light to our ſouls.</p>

               <hi>The greateſt difference</hi> (that I know) <hi>in all the Book of God, between Saints and Sinners is, that the one hath the Spirit, and the other hath not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are a thouſand differences even in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but they are none of them ſo <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> as this, that a <hi>Saint,</hi> is a man that <hi>hath the Spirit,</hi> and a <hi>Sinner</hi> is one that hath <hi>not the Spirit,</hi> one that is <hi>without the Spirit.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtles when they were Preaching, and met with any <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> they asked preſently, <hi>Have ye received the Spirit?</hi> It is not meant <hi>onely,</hi> nor <hi>chiefly</hi> of the <hi>common gifts of the Spirit,</hi> but certainly it is meant principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>ſpirit of holineſs, Have you received the holy Ghoſt or no?</hi> So our Lord Chriſt ſpeaking of the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> (to ſee what a bleſſed thing it is to ſee heavenly things in the <hi>language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> a thing that if we could grow up to, we ſhould overthrow a thouſand <hi>diſtinctions</hi> in Divinity; we miſtake things, taking them in the <hi>old Notion) John</hi> 14. what is the difference between the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>people of Chriſt? I will ſend thc Spirit which the world cannot receive.</hi> The <hi>world</hi> are men that have not, nor cannot receive the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> are thoſe that do, and have received the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> You read in 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18. of men that had <hi>made a great profeſsion</hi> that were <hi>faln off,</hi> that were <hi>faln away,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.</hi> There are many <hi>faln away,</hi> ſaith he, but they were not <hi>of us.</hi> Why? What are <hi>you?</hi> might ſome
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:117675:109"/> ſay: <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have received an unction, an anoynting, and it abides with us. And ye need not that any ſhould teach you, that will teach you all things.</hi> They that <hi>fall off,</hi> they were not <hi>of us.</hi> Why? they have not the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> therefore they were not <hi>of us.</hi> So when the Apoſtles <hi>preached,</hi> ſometimes it is ſaid that <hi>ſome</hi> of them <hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>ſome</hi> did not; and at other times it is ſaid when they <hi>preached</hi> that the <hi>Spirit of God did fall upon the people,</hi> that is, they were <hi>converted,</hi> they were <hi>born again,</hi> they were made <hi>Saints.</hi> So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of being <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>out of Chriſt,</hi> which is the <hi>great point</hi> of all, and ſalvation and damnation hangs upon it. This is his <hi>language,</hi> they that are in <hi>Chriſt, walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit.</hi> So in the language of the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> the <hi>maine</hi> thing that belongs to a <hi>Saint,</hi> it is not as we ordinarily account it: there are a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred things that we call <hi>Religion</hi> that God doth not. A drunkard may be ſtricken with <hi>terrour</hi> in <hi>hearing the word,</hi> and we ſay ſuch a one is <hi>converted,</hi> and it may be <hi>not;</hi> and there are hundreds of other people that may <hi>pray twice a day,</hi> and <hi>hear Sermons,</hi> and <hi>repeat them,</hi> and out of a <hi>naturall principle of devotion</hi> may have <hi>affections:</hi> this is not <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> There are abundance of <hi>profeſſours</hi> among us, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> will not <hi>own,</hi> becauſe they <hi>have not the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>maine way</hi> whereby we may judge of a <hi>Saint</hi> or a <hi>ſinner,</hi> is whether he have <hi>the ſpirit of God in him</hi> or no. O ſuch a one doth <hi>great things,</hi> he <hi>prayes,</hi> and <hi>hears,</hi> and <hi>reads,</hi> and <hi>diſputes much:</hi> I <hi>but hath he the ſpirit, or no?</hi>

            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:117675:110"/>
            <p> But you will ſay, How ſhall I look for that? How ſhall I know that?</p>
            <p>I will tell you how; A man may know the <hi>ſpirit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Spirit in us to be known by its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> in himſelf clearly by the <hi>evidence of the ſame ſpirit,</hi> And a man that hath the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may know the <hi>ſpirit in another</hi> by the ſpirit. There is a kind of <hi>Sagacity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Saints,</hi> whereby they <hi>having the ſpirit</hi> are able (though not <hi>expreſly,</hi> and <hi>clearly)</hi> to behold the <hi>ſpirit in another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are the ſons of God, but the world knows us not:</hi> worldly men know not the <hi>Saints</hi> from <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks:</hi> and uſually ſpirituall people receive thoſe names from the world, <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and the like. But a man that <hi>hath the ſpirit of God,</hi> he can ſee as <hi>clearly</hi> as a natural man can with his eyes. How can a poor lamb <hi>know</hi> the <hi>dam</hi> among a thouſand? There is a <hi>Sagacitie</hi> in nature, and ſo there is here in <hi>grace,</hi> they have <hi>the ſame ſpirit.</hi> As when <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were talking, the <hi>Babe in Elizabeths Womb leaped,</hi> hearing the words of <hi>Mary,</hi> that then had the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> conceived in her. I give you but a little <hi>reſemblance</hi> from naturall things. The Saints <hi>know it,</hi> and their <hi>fellowſhip</hi> is in the ſpirit. Our <hi>communion is in God,</hi> and not in ſuch a <hi>Covenant;</hi> or meerly in outward duties: but our <hi>communion is with the Father, and with his ſon Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in the <hi>ſpirit</hi> with all his <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore labor for the <hi>ſpirit of God.</hi> Truly, God is now coming, I am confident it is his <hi>deſigne</hi> in theſe <hi>latter times</hi> to <hi>exalt</hi> his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and to <hi>pull,</hi> and <hi>throw down</hi> every thing that exalts it ſelf <hi>againſt</hi> the ſpirit, that ſtands in his light, and <hi>Eclipſeth</hi> the glory
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:117675:110"/> of it. And though the world which cannot receive the <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> do either <hi>blaſpheme,</hi> or elſe do <hi>ſet little</hi> by it, yet ſurely it is the <hi>will of God</hi> that all his <hi>children</hi> ſhould <hi>honour</hi> it.

            <p>I ſpeak not againſt <hi>learning</hi> ſimply, it is uſefull, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> but as far as <hi>learning</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trencheth upon the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> God will <hi>blaſt</hi> it: <hi>learned men</hi> ſhall be <hi>laid by</hi> as Cyphers, God will <hi>blaſt</hi> their labours, that we might <hi>honour the ſpirit.</hi> There is one place that comes to my heart with much <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pſal.</hi> 119. 96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy law is very broad.</hi> We have ſeen an <hi>end</hi> of <hi>all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>learning,</hi> of <hi>common gifts,</hi> of <hi>naturall</hi> parts; we have ſeen <hi>God blaſt</hi> theſe one after another: <hi>but Gods law is very broad.</hi> The <hi>morall</hi> law, the <hi>law of the letter</hi> is <hi>broad,</hi> much more the <hi>law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt,</hi> that is <hi>extolled</hi> more and more: therefore all muſt <hi>down</hi> to <hi>extoll the ſpirit of God.</hi>

            <p>Truly <hi>Religion</hi> is a hundred wayes <hi>miſtaken</hi> by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I could give a hundred inſtances, eſpecially in your <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> where it is asked; <hi>What is Religion?</hi> It is ſuch, and ſuch. <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> under the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> conſiſts of <hi>two things, Chriſt crucified,</hi> and the <hi>pouring out of the ſpirit of God.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>two pillars</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>New</hi>

            <p>We ſpeak much of <hi>reformation,</hi> and it is to be <hi>deſired;</hi> but among other <hi>errours</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> this is one: many think that the <hi>main point</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is the <hi>ſetting up</hi> of <hi>government;</hi> whereas our <hi>main reformation</hi> is in <hi>pulling down,</hi> and not in <hi>ſetting up:</hi> for we have a world of <hi>inſtitutions</hi> ſet up that will never hold.

But when our <hi>Bibles</hi> have gone through the hands of <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſo many <hi>hundered yeers,</hi> when a man ſhall come to <hi>die</hi> for it, he is afraid that ſuch a thing may be <hi>crept into the text,</hi> &amp; a thouſand ſuch thoughts of <hi>Athieſme</hi> will come upon a man: but when a man can ſay, this is <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt pouring out of his ſpirit,</hi> let the <hi>particles,</hi> and the <hi>words</hi> run as they will, this is the <hi>maine</hi> that will hold.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Goſpell</hi> was <hi>intended,</hi> and <hi>deſigned</hi> for <hi>ſimple men</hi> more then <hi>others,</hi> ſo (with reverence) the <hi>Goſpell</hi> is a more <hi>ſimple, plain thing</hi> then moſt men in the world conceive.

               <hi>Saints, Ye have an unction,</hi> or an annointing, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. and that was the <hi>bleſſed ſpirit.</hi>

            <p>Truly (beloved) it is a <hi>comfortable</hi> thing (in reſpect of himſelf) for a <hi>poor creature</hi> to ſee many <hi>ſtumble at the word of God;</hi> whereas if we would <hi>reſolve to be wiſe</hi> in the <hi>wiſdom of God,</hi> and to ſpeak of things as the <hi>Scripture ſpeaks,</hi> to look on things as the <hi>Scripture</hi> looks on them, to uſe thoſe <hi>phraſes,</hi> and <hi>expreſsions,</hi> and thoſe <hi>notions,</hi> we ſhould underſtand many <hi>myſteries in godlineſſe,</hi> which now are little leſſe then <hi>ſtumbling blocks</hi> to us: becauſe there is a kind of <hi>thwarting wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in us that is croſſe to that.</p>
            <p>God is now (I told you) about to <hi>exalt the ſpirit,</hi> yet not in a way <hi>contrary to the Scripture,</hi> but the <hi>ſpirit in the Scripture</hi> I mean. Therefore <hi>learn this leſson,</hi> to ſtrive for this as the <hi>chief thing,</hi> to finde <hi>the ſpirit of God</hi> in you, <hi>dwelling</hi> and <hi>working</hi> in you, becauſe as in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> there was one <hi>great promiſe</hi> (to wit) of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that was the <hi>great promiſe,</hi> and all other <hi>promiſes belonged</hi> to that. So in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> there is but <hi>one great promiſe,</hi> the <hi>promiſe of the father</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls it, and that is the <hi>pouring out of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as the <hi>Lord</hi> hath been <hi>teaching</hi> us of <hi>late yeers</hi> to know his Son <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>juſtification,</hi> where <hi>our righteouſneſſe</hi> lies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So let us not think theſe <hi>ſpeculations</hi> enough, but take the other <hi>maine thing</hi> that is as great as this, the <hi>doctrine of the ſpirit.</hi> That I may as well finde the <hi>ſpirit working</hi> in me, as to know <hi>without</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> died for me.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Religion</hi> were <hi>ſtated aright,</hi> I mean <hi>Chriſtianity, Chriſtian Religion</hi> under the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> not in

               <hi>books,</hi> but the <hi>life of Chriſtianty,</hi> it would be to know <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> and to enjoy the <hi>ſpirit of Chriſt:</hi> that when we read the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and caſt up <hi>the bill of account</hi> when we have done, there is the <hi>ſum</hi> of all; the <hi>two hinges</hi> that all goes on. Therefore <hi>take heed of being deceived</hi> by <hi>notionall knowledge</hi> of things onely <hi>without you,</hi> though it be never ſo <hi>glorious.</hi> For if thou be a <hi>Saint,</hi> thou haſt the <hi>Spirit of God really dwelling</hi> in thee in its meaſure, as truly as in the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as it is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. the latter end, <hi>the ſpirit that works in them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> is a <hi>glorious</hi> thing. It is that that not only makes the <hi>grand difference</hi> between a <hi>Saint</hi> and a <hi>ſinner,</hi> but even in a <hi>godly man,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is <hi>all in all</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> Let the <hi>ſpirit</hi> but ſtir in him, though he be never ſo <hi>dark</hi> yet all is <hi>light</hi> before him. Let the <hi>ſpirit</hi> come and <hi>comfort</hi> him, though he be in <hi>chains of Iron,</hi> though he be in the <hi>greateſt miſery</hi> in this world, yet he can <hi>ſing Pſalms.</hi> Let the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> be given him, and then not only <hi>faith,</hi> and the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> but <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>common providences,</hi> every thing ſpeaks the <hi>love of God</hi> to his ſoul. But let the <hi>ſpirit withdraw from him,</hi> if the <hi>Lord</hi> take away <hi>his ſpirit</hi> but for a <hi>moment,</hi> even from the <hi>beſt Saint,</hi> his <hi>body</hi> and his <hi>ſoul</hi> are no better (If I may ſpeake it) then a meer <hi>carrion.</hi> I allude to that of <hi>Iames, The body without the ſoul is dead.</hi> So take the body and ſoul without the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> it is <hi>dead.</hi> Dead? What is that? Thus, take a <hi>living</hi> body (that I may follow the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a little) there is no <hi>living</hi> body but he can <hi>do</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: though ſome can do <hi>more</hi> then others, yet every <hi>living</hi> body can <hi>do ſomething,</hi> he can <hi>ſit,</hi> or <hi>walk,</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:117675:113"/> or <hi>talk,</hi> &amp;c. And as he can do <hi>ſome good,</hi> ſo he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>ſome evil.</hi> If a man be <hi>dying</hi> almoſt, if you go to <hi>poure water</hi> in his <hi>throat,</hi> he can <hi>turn</hi> his head aſide. But let the <hi>ſoul</hi> be away, he can neither <hi>do any good</hi> (I ſpeak now of <hi>naturall, civill</hi> good) or <hi>reſiſt evil.</hi> So it is with the <hi>ſoul,</hi> let the <hi>Lord</hi> take away <hi>his ſpirit,</hi> and we are <hi>quite flat:</hi> Let the <hi>Lord</hi> propoſe any <hi>good work to do,</hi> let any part of the <hi>will of God</hi> be preſented, there is <hi>no ſtirring</hi> at all in the ſoul towards it, the heart lyes <hi>gaping,</hi> and is dead; Let any <hi>luſt</hi> or <hi>ſin</hi> come, any <hi>temptation</hi> though it be never ſo <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>feeble,</hi> there is no <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> there is an <hi>inrode</hi> into the ſoul without any <hi>oppoſition,</hi> let <hi>pride,</hi> or <hi>frowardneſs,</hi> or <hi>filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>worldlineſs</hi> come, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>reſiſt</hi> it, becauſe the <hi>life</hi> of the ſoul is away, which is the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this an <hi>excellent thing</hi> then, for a man to have the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> dwelling in him? that when <hi>good</hi> is propoſed to him, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may (as it were) <hi>ſwitch</hi> him, It is a homely expreſſion, but I have found it by experience. As a <hi>jade</hi> with a good <hi>ſwitch</hi> is ſet on to the journey, or to his buſineſſe; ſo when the ſoul of a man hath ſomewhat within to <hi>ſwitch</hi> him to cauſe him to cloſe with <hi>good things,</hi> to <hi>lay hold</hi> on them, to attempt <hi>them</hi> at <hi>leaſt:</hi> Whereas when the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is <hi>away,</hi> there is <hi>no ſtirring;</hi> the ſoul is as <hi>flat,</hi> and as <hi>dead;</hi> as water in a <hi>ſtinking ditch.</hi> This is the <hi>excellency of the ſpirit.</hi> Therefore you that have it, <hi>prize</hi> it. There are ſome that if they had it again as once they had, they would <hi>prize</hi> it, and <hi>praiſe God</hi> for it, and would now give a world for it. Therefore you that have theſe <hi>ſtirrings of the ſpirit</hi> in you to make
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:117675:113"/> you <hi>cloſe</hi> with good, and to <hi>reſiſt</hi> evil in ſome meaſure; bleſs God, and praiſe his name for it.</p>
            <p>That is the thing I drive at, that you may ſee the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>worth,</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in your ſouls. When the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is away from the ſoul, all the <hi>ſeals</hi> of Gods Love, and the <hi>ſigns</hi> of his Favor, they are <hi>cut off</hi> at one daſh as it were; I mean thus, when the <hi>Spirit of God dwels</hi> in the ſoul, you could read the <hi>love of God</hi> in every <hi>Ordinance,</hi> you could <hi>ſee it in every Grace,</hi> and in every <hi>Promiſe</hi> in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> in every thing: and you could ſee one while your <hi>election</hi> with joy, and another while <hi>Gods everlaſting love</hi> with joy, and another while the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> and another while your <hi>union with him,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while your <hi>Redemption,</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> and Gods Love <hi>ſealed</hi> in all theſe; Nay, in <hi>every creature</hi> you could <hi>taſte</hi> the Love of <hi>God,</hi> in your <hi>cloathes,</hi> and your <hi>meat,</hi> and every thing: But let the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> be <hi>gone,</hi> and all theſe are <hi>gone:</hi> Take all <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Mercies,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments;</hi> they ſeal not one ſpark of the Love of God, but they are all <hi>dead, ſpeechleſs things,</hi> that ſignifie and ſpeak <hi>no comfort</hi> at the beſt, and it may be <hi>horror,</hi> that a man may read (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid) his <hi>Reprobation,</hi> in that which a few hours before he could have read his <hi>election</hi> in; and thoſe Scriptures all along that he could ſweetly have ſeen the <hi>Will of God in,</hi> and could ſay, that which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath entred into the hart of man, that I have ſeen,</hi> he can ſhut his Bible, and ſay, and almoſt ſwear that he underſtands not one <hi>tittle</hi> in it.

            <p>And more then ſo, he is not now deprived only of all <hi>light,</hi> of all <hi>Knowledg,</hi> of all <hi>aſſurance,</hi> of all <hi>comfort,</hi> of all <hi>ſtrength,</hi> either to <hi>do good,</hi> or to reſiſt <hi>evil:</hi> but there is <hi>poſitive horror</hi> in the heart, poſitive <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>terror,</hi> and <hi>darkneſs:</hi> a <hi>bondage to unbelief</hi> ſeizing upon him; That as our Lord ſaith, The Spirit is like winde, <hi>that no man knows whence it comes, or whither it goes:</hi> So he feels a <hi>miſery</hi> in his ſoul, that he knows not <hi>whence it comes,</hi> or <hi>where it will end:</hi> As it was ſaid of the <hi>Powder plot,</hi> the <hi>Powder Treaſon,</hi> that there ſhould be a <hi>blow given</hi> that none ſhould know <hi>whence</hi> it was: ſo he ſees a <hi>blow given</hi> to his ſoul, and the <hi>life</hi> of it, and all that is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> in it, and he knows not <hi>whence</hi> it is; he can ſay, that his <hi>ſoul</hi> is no other then a <hi>plain hell,</hi> for there is no <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evil</hi> in <hi>hell</hi> but it is <hi>there,</hi> and there is no <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evil,</hi> no evil of <hi>deprivation</hi> of any thing that is good, but he feels it <hi>there;</hi> ſo that in all our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Graces,</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurances,</hi> and <hi>Evidences,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>life</hi> of all.</p>
            <p>Therefore no wonder that <hi>David</hi> (who was a Type of a <hi>Goſpel Chriſtian)</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Create in me, O Lord, a new heart, andrenew and reſtore thy holy Spirit:</hi> as if he had ſaid, ſince thy <hi>holy Spirit</hi> went away there is an <hi>annihilation,</hi> all that is in me is <hi>annihilated.</hi> He doth not ſay, mend, and repair, but <hi>create:</hi> I ſee not ſo much as a <hi>ſtump of Grace,</hi> a <hi>root,</hi> or a <hi>habit,</hi> or any

            <p>Therefore, I ſay, you that have it <hi>priſe</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and you that have it not, <hi>labor</hi> to have it, and endeavor to <hi>pleaſe</hi> and to <hi>entertain the Spirit:</hi> for the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are the ſame as it were, they are taken one for another; <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwels in us, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> dwels in us, and ſaith the <hi>Spouſe</hi> in the <hi>Canticles, I will take my beloved, and bring him to my mothers Chamber, and let none call my beloved, or wake him till he pleaſe;</hi> Study to give all <hi>contentment</hi> to the <hi>Spirit of God, croſs</hi> him
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:117675:116"/> not, <hi>thwart him</hi> not, <hi>vex him</hi> not, but <hi>entertain him,</hi> for he is your <hi>life,</hi> and you are nothing but <hi>fleſh</hi> when he is gone.</p>
            <p>It may be God hath other <hi>deſigns</hi> in it, otherwiſe when God takes away his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and leaves my ſoul in <hi>deſertion,</hi> if I did not think God had a <hi>deſign</hi> in it for his <hi>own glory</hi> and <hi>my good,</hi> I ſhould utterly ſink; Therefore God ſometimes <hi>takes away</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to the end that we may know the <hi>worth</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> how to <hi>prize</hi> it, and to pitty people that have it not, and to <hi>pleaſe</hi> it with more <hi>carefulneſs</hi> if God ever give it us again.</p>

            <p>Every body ſeeks to <hi>dreſs</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to make it <hi>more curious,</hi> but few labor to <hi>reduce</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to its <hi>native ſimplicity.</hi> One Generation <hi>dreſſeth</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> moſt <hi>bravely</hi> with <hi>humane learning.</hi> Though I will not ſimply ſpeak againſt <hi>humane learning,</hi> it is good, as fire when it is put on the hearth; ſo <hi>humane learning</hi> when it is put in its <hi>own place,</hi> it is a good thing; but the <hi>uſe</hi> that men make of it, to <hi>dreſs</hi> the ſimplicity of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> with it, makes it abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

            <p>Therefore I exhort you to ſtick to the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And do not think it is a <hi>ſmall</hi> thing; it is a <hi>great buſineſs</hi> that I exhort you to. Why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde that there are many <hi>ſouls</hi> that make <hi>ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi> of their own <hi>ſalvation,</hi> by flying <hi>too high</hi> above the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> They <hi>loſe</hi> themſelves, they run through <hi>all Religions</hi> (as ſome ſay) and at laſt come to be nothing at all. And I am ſure of it, they deſtroy the <hi>faith</hi> of others, I am ſure of that, almoſt by experience, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander, They deſtroy the faith of many.</hi> That when a <hi>poor tender-hearted Chriſtian</hi> hears them talk ſo <hi>high,</hi> and is not able to underſtand <hi>litterally</hi> a word that is ſaid, ſaith he, I have nothing in the world, I never knew <hi>God</hi> aright, becauſe I ſee that I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a word of this, and a world of evils more.</p>
            <p>And I have obſerved, and do obſerve it, That uſually thoſe kinde of people that are ſo led, when they, have ſuch <hi>Chymera</hi>'s and <hi>Notions</hi> in their heads, they <hi>nullifie</hi> all <hi>Religion</hi> beſides, and all but that is nothing; and one <hi>Chymera</hi> carries the bell one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a yeer, and then that is laid aſide, and then they have another <hi>notion,</hi> and that is all the <hi>Religion;</hi> and then away goes that, and then there comes a <hi>third.</hi> Theſe deſtroy the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>poor ſouls</hi> in <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> and <hi>juſtification</hi> by him, and <hi>holineſs</hi> to him; and all <hi>holy duties</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> this is <hi>deſtroyed.</hi>

            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:117675:118"/>
            <p> Therefore my <hi>Exhortation</hi> to you, is, and it is a bleſſed word that I have thought much of, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, <hi>Be of the ſame minde one towards another. Minde not high things.</hi> Mark that word. We have a kinde of expreſſion in our times of <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower light;</hi> and (which is more, immodeſt) people attribute the <hi>higher light</hi> to themſelves: We are of the <hi>higher light,</hi> ſay they. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Minde not high things.</hi> How? It is not meant in <hi>carnal things,</hi> that is, Minde not to get <hi>high Offices,</hi> or <hi>places,</hi> or <hi>prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the like. But he ſpeaks of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things, as it is clear, if you compare the third verſe. <hi>For I ſay, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you; not to think of himſelf more highly, then he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according as God hath delt to every man the meaſure of faith.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I finde many among you, that <hi>ſublimate</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> almoſt into <hi>air,</hi> in <hi>high conceits,</hi> and <hi>Idea's,</hi> and <hi>notions,</hi> and leave <hi>poor Chriſt crucified,</hi> and the <hi>ſimple Goſpel</hi> preached by <hi>fiſhermen. I would not have you wiſe, above that which is meet; not to minde high things, but condeſcend to them of the lower ſort.</hi> The <hi>excellency</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is the <hi>plainneſs</hi> of it; and that is the reaſon, that you mar it with any kinde of <hi>dreſsing,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>excellent</hi> in it ſelf If a man have a ſuite of Skarlet that is extraordinary good, all-to-be-laid with copper lace, it mars it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cloth is good of it ſelf. So all <hi>dreſsing</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> marrs it, becauſe it is <hi>excellent</hi> of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>When you meet with people that tell you, that all your <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>nothing,</hi> and tell you <hi>Chymera's,</hi> and <hi>high things</hi> that may <hi>ſhine bravely</hi> for a while: Think
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:117675:119"/> of this, I muſt not minde <hi>high things,</hi> but <hi>condeſcend to them that are low.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle in thoſe times, when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was <hi>preached,</hi> and <hi>perverted</hi> by <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>oppoſitions of Science, falſly ſo called,</hi> many <hi>fine tricks</hi> they had to <hi>adorn</hi> the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> he calls them alway to <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> and tells them, that was the <hi>height,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>bredth,</hi> and <hi>length of all knowledg;</hi> as the <hi>height,</hi> and <hi>bredth,</hi> and <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>depth</hi> of a board, or of a thing; it is the whole <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions</hi> of a board, it is the <hi>whole board.</hi> So the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> is the <hi>height,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>bredth,</hi> and <hi>length</hi> of all <hi>knowledg;</hi> that is, It is <hi>all knowledg</hi> to know <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> in the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> He oppoſeth not <hi>Philoſophy</hi> to <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> to <hi>Science;</hi> but he ſaith, Ye are <hi>compleat</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and calls them to his <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection.</hi> So keep cloſe to that.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak it the rather, becauſe where there are ſuch <hi>notions ſtarted</hi> up among us <hi>daily</hi> now of late, they clearly draw us from <hi>Chriſt crucified.</hi> A <hi>Platonical</hi> kinde of <hi>Religion,</hi> a kinde of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> a kinde of conſideration of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>own nature</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Beware of this <hi>ambition.</hi> It is enough for you, and me to know <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>him crucified,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> according to the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the plain <hi>Goſpel</hi> once preached by <hi>fiſhermen,</hi> to <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>baſe people,</hi> and things of no worth.</p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech you ſtick to <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> and to the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>plainneſs</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> I would not have you to ſtick in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and to go no further, but labor for the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> through
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:117675:119"/> the Letter, to be in your ſouls. I know <hi>God</hi> many times by theſe <hi>broken words,</hi> may do your ſouls good; but this is a thing, that I confeſs my ſoul is ſo full of, that I am not able to <hi>expreſs</hi> it, to <hi>vent,</hi> and <hi>open</hi> my ſelf. The <hi>miſchief,</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> that befals people, by <hi>ſoaring</hi> above the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> above the <hi>plainneſs</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ye hear that they do <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and <hi>others;</hi> and the <hi>ſafeties,</hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> that will be to your ſouls in keeping to the <hi>plain, ſimple way</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had another <hi>ſhort leſſon,</hi> but I am loath to thruſt out one duty with another.

            <p>Methinks it is a more <hi>glorious Truth,</hi> then we have judged it to be, that <hi>poor Saints</hi> are <hi>one</hi> with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is anointed, and ſo are <hi>they;</hi> we have the <hi>ſame unction</hi> with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we have the <hi>ſame name</hi> with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we have the <hi>ſame Offices</hi> with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we have the <hi>ſame love of God</hi> with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we have the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.

            <p>Therefore this uſe we ſhould make of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> not to be as <hi>babies</hi> always, to read a <hi>Chapter</hi> morning and evening; but you that are experienced <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when you have a truth <hi>hinted</hi> to you, be alway at the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to <hi>beat it out.</hi> As for inſtance, go home now, and ſtudy that <hi>Oneneſs,</hi> that <hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall deſire leave at this time, a little more <hi>familiarly,</hi> then uſually, to tell you what I conceive is the <hi>will of the Lord,</hi> becauſe I do not expect to ſpeak to you any more.</p>
            <p>I remember a little before the <hi>Lord</hi> had brought us together, before the <hi>deſolation</hi> of that <note n="*" place="margin">Briſtol.</note> City, (which indeed was <hi>greater</hi> then any man can <hi>imagine,</hi> unleſs he had been there preſent) the <hi>Lord</hi> by his providence guided me to expound, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. concerning the <hi>deſolation of Ieruſalem,</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:117675:121"/> little thinking, or imagining, that the <hi>deſolation</hi> of that place had been ſo near. And now that word that was then ſpoken by <hi>providence,</hi> was (as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived afterwards) a very great <hi>ſtay,</hi> and <hi>refreſhing</hi> to the <hi>ſouls</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> in their trouble. By <hi>providence</hi> alſo, (not by any way of propheſie, I never was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted that way, but by providence) <hi>reading</hi> this <hi>Chapter</hi> in my <hi>family,</hi> and ſeriouſly <hi>conſidering</hi> of it, me-thoughts the <hi>Lord</hi> repreſented to me in a way, a little more then uſual, the <hi>ſtate of this City,</hi> wherein you now live, and are to live; and that by the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is here laid down throughout the Chapter. For though we cannot tell you now of <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> as the <hi>Prophets</hi> did, by <hi>revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>viſions,</hi> and the like; yet what is written, is <hi>written for our inſtruction.</hi> And the <hi>Lord</hi> hath given us <hi>examples</hi> of his <hi>judgments,</hi> that we may <hi>learn</hi> from them, what to <hi>think,</hi> and how to <hi>judg</hi> of other <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> that are <hi>parallel,</hi> that are <hi>like</hi> to thoſe that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>viſited,</hi> or <hi>deſtroyed</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. Therefore I ſhall briefly lay down the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as it is here in this Chapter. Here are things ſpoken promiſcuouſly, becauſe here in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> there are but the <hi>heads</hi> (as it were) of their preaching; therefore for <hi>method,</hi> and your <hi>memories</hi> ſake, I will digeſt the <hi>condition of Ieruſalem,</hi> and what is here ſaid of it, and about it, into theſe heads briefly.</p>
            <p>But firſt of all, before I ſpeak of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> it-ſelf, ye are to obſerve the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Prophet</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> had ſet among them, which is laid down at Verſ. 27. <hi>I have ſet thee for a tower, and a fortreſs among</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:117675:122"/> 
               <hi>my people, that thou mayeſt know, and try their way.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> compares the <hi>Prophet</hi> to a <hi>tower</hi> in the <hi>City;</hi> that is, a <hi>watch-tower:</hi> A <hi>tower</hi> for <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as it is <hi>Iere.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>I have made thee an iron pillar, and brazen walls:</hi> That though he preached <hi>contrary</hi> to their <hi>corruptions,</hi> yet they could not <hi>touch</hi> him. And a <hi>tower</hi> for <hi>watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Prophets</hi> did <hi>watch</hi> as out of a <hi>tower,</hi> all the <hi>City,</hi> and all in it, and the <hi>enemies</hi> that were againſt it So the <hi>Prophets</hi> were called <hi>Seers</hi> in thoſe days; <hi>eying</hi> the <hi>ſins</hi> of the people, and <hi>eying</hi> the <hi>judgments</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>eying</hi> what <hi>comfort</hi> on the otherſide <hi>God</hi> gave to any among them. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> I ſay, were <hi>towers,</hi> and ſhould be ſtill. They are called <hi>trumpets</hi> here, <hi>I will ſend a trumpet, and cauſe it to blow, but the people will not hearken.</hi> They are <hi>watchmen,</hi> to give warning to the people; ſo they ſhould be: I leave it to you to judg, (for you know the ſtate of this place better then I) whether we be ſo, or no.</p>
            <p>The next thing in this Chapter, is, The ſtate of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> what kinde of place it was, I mean, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>building</hi> of it, and the <hi>ſcituation</hi> of it, (for I mean to gather up the whole Chapter in a little method) take it as it is deſcribed, Verſe 2. <hi>I have likened the daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>to a comely and delicate woman.</hi> His meaning is, not for any <hi>ſpiritual beauty</hi> in her, as appears in the whole Chapter; but in an <hi>outward</hi> ſenſe, in reſpect of <hi>ſcituation</hi> and <hi>gallant build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> it was a <hi>magnificent</hi> place, and no man was able to <hi>count the towers</hi> about it. It was a ſtately gallant place, and therefore was like a <hi>delicate woman.</hi> A ſtately place, full of <hi>caſe,</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>trading,</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:117675:122"/> and <hi>good creatures,</hi> and altogether exact, as a delicate Gentlewoman, nothing was wanting: ſo <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was; and yet for all that, you afterwards ſee how the <hi>Lord</hi> did deal with her. So, by the way, let me tell you this (for I ſpeak in the ſight of God) That the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of your <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>fairneſs</hi> of it, the <hi>riches</hi> of which you were wont to boaſt, how you did rule all Kingdoms beſides, you could make <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and do any thing; you have ſuch <hi>Ships,</hi> and <hi>Towers,</hi> and <hi>Armies,</hi> and <hi>Armed men;</hi> you ſee what <hi>God</hi> ſaith of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when he was going to deſtroy her, <hi>I have likened her to a fair delicate woman,</hi> and yet all could not excuſe her. If the <hi>Lord</hi> come againſt you, all your <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>trading,</hi> and <hi>gallantry,</hi> cannot excuſe you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is all the <hi>good</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>godlineſs;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> acknowledgeth that too, and the <hi>Lord</hi> will not forget any <hi>good</hi> thing among them; that you ſhall ſee in Verſe 20. <hi>To what purpoſe cometh there to me incenſe from</hi> Sheba? <hi>and the ſweet Cane from a far country? your burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not acceptable, nor your ſacrifices ſweet unto me. Ieruſalem</hi> did not forget the ſervice of <hi>God,</hi> they had their <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> and they had <hi>ſweet Cane from Sheba.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> complains in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42. that the people did bring him no <hi>ſweet Cane;</hi> it was their maner in their <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> I acknowledg, ſaith <hi>God,</hi> you have a great deal of <hi>Religion,</hi> and you talk of <hi>Reformation</hi> among you, and <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> and I know not what; yet notwithſtanding, this ſhall not hinder, but for all your <hi>villanies</hi> and <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,</hi> this is the City to be <hi>viſited</hi> for all this. It is
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:117675:123"/> not a <hi>little grain</hi> of Wheat that can cover a <hi>Mountain</hi> of Chaff. It is not a little <hi>formal, fained, hypocritical</hi> ſervice of <hi>God,</hi> and a quarter, and talking, and a clutter about <hi>Reformation,</hi> that can hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>God</hi> againſt a people that are <hi>really ſinful,</hi> and that have <hi>really</hi> and <hi>grievouſly</hi> revolted.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing here laid down, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly (that I ſhall endevor to gather up for you orderly) it is the <hi>ſins</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of no more then is laid down here, and they are in this place four. Here are four <hi>great ſins</hi> that <hi>God</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, the <hi>oppreſsion;</hi> obſerve that word in Verſe 6. For thus hath the <hi>Lord</hi> of Hoſts ſaid, <hi>This is the City to be viſited, ſhe is wholly oppreſsion in the midſt of her.</hi> He ſaith not, <hi>There is oppreſsion in the middeſt of her, or in her, but ſhe is wholly oppreſsion.</hi> As if he had ſaid, She is <hi>built with oppreſsion,</hi> her very <hi>fabrick is oppreſsion:</hi> She is <hi>oppreſsion it ſelf, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>upright in heart;</hi> there is nothing but <hi>railing againſt,</hi> and <hi>ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> of them, as we ſee after.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Lord</hi> opens that, <hi>She was oppreſsion;</hi> that you may know the meaning of it, he tells you after. <hi>As a fountain caſteth out her waters, ſo ſhe caſteth out her wickedneſs: violence, and ſpoyl is heard in her, before me continually is grief, and wounds, ſaith the Lord.</hi> She is <hi>oppreſsion; as a fountain caſteth forth water.</hi> What is a <hi>fountain?</hi> It is a hole in the Earth that <hi>caſts out water;</hi> ſo ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> I ſee nothing in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> from <hi>one day to another,</hi> from <hi>one yeer to another,</hi> and from <hi>one end of the City to another,</hi> but <hi>oppreſsion.</hi> I ſee one <hi>oppreſs</hi>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:117675:123"/> another: I ſee it full of <hi>wounds</hi> and <hi>griefs,</hi> and <hi>bruiſes,</hi> eſpecially to my <hi>poor Saints,</hi> there is <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion.</hi> And I leave you to judg this day, whether this City, at this time, be not ſo: She is <hi>wholly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion,</hi> from the leaſt to the greateſt, there is almoſt nothing elſe to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Then, the ſecond ſin the <hi>Lord</hi> layes down, is in Verſe 13. <hi>That every one is given to covetouſneſs.</hi> Mark that word, and let every one of your own conſciences apply it. <hi>For, from the leaſt, even to the greateſt of them, every one is given to covetouſneſs.</hi> O, this <hi>covetouſneſs!</hi> there can be no <hi>Reformation,</hi> either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as things are, becauſe of <hi>covetous people.</hi> If there be any <hi>good courſe</hi> taken by Magiſtrates to <hi>reform</hi> any buſineſs in <hi>Courts</hi> or <hi>Offices,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> of people, the buſineſs is <hi>marred,</hi> you all know it. And ſo far <hi>outward Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> and the like, becauſe of <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> you all know that the buſineſs of <hi>Reformation is marred; Miniſters</hi> have <hi>loſt</hi> themſelves: There are many godly men that had <hi>room</hi> in the hearts of <hi>Gods people,</hi> ſome in this <hi>City,</hi> and in the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> that had room in the <hi>hearts</hi> of <hi>Gods people</hi> before <hi>theſe times,</hi> and before they had all things in their <hi>own hands,</hi> and became <hi>reformers</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> now becauſe of <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> all is <hi>marred,</hi> that no buſineſs can be looked upon. Now the <hi>Lord</hi> look upon us; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though we ſee not him, he ſees us, and looks on us.</p>
            <p>Then, the third ſin is laid down in Verſe 13, 14. that is, <hi>The falſe dealing of the Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters. From the Prophet, even to the Prieſt, every one dealeth</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:117675:124"/> 
               <hi>falſly.</hi> How is that? <hi>They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly; ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> The Prophets <hi>deal falſly,</hi> they are become <hi>hypocrites;</hi> they tell the people, they are in a <hi>gallant way of Reformation;</hi> when the <hi>Lord</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, both according to Scripture, and ſound Reaſon, they are in the <hi>way to deſtruction;</hi> they tell them now, <hi>the Church, and Reformation is going up,</hi> when the poor <hi>Kingdom</hi> was never in ſuch a <hi>ſad condition.</hi> They <hi>deal falſly,</hi> that is, <hi>hypocritically.</hi> What a ſtir is there here about <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and about <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> and what <hi>conſulting,</hi> and <hi>working,</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> and elſewhere; and yet when there is any <hi>work</hi> to be done <hi>really</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> no body <hi>mindes</hi> it. I will give you an inſtance, as clear as the Sun: There hath been of late, a great deal of <hi>conſulting,</hi> and making <hi>Petitions,</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrances,</hi> and <hi>Repreſentations,</hi> and <hi>Modelizing</hi> the <hi>Common Councel, &amp;c.</hi> And yet we have had the <hi>Superſtition</hi> of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> worſe then it hath been this four yeers to my knowledg; every one <hi>ſhutting up their ſhops,</hi> and giving themſelves up to <hi>Superſtitious</hi> ways, that we thought had been dead.</p>
            <p>Come to the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly:</hi> Is there any <hi>complotting</hi> to draw people from <hi>falſe, groſs Popery?</hi> No, they <hi>deal falſly:</hi> There is no <hi>aſſembling</hi> or <hi>meeting</hi> about that; but the <hi>Miniſters</hi> let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple go. I ſpeak it with the grief of my ſoul: If it were on the <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> it were no wonder, but to ſee people here to go in droves to <hi>Popery!</hi> I behold it as I go along in the ſtreet, and think I, with a heavy heart; how <hi>neatly</hi> doth <hi>Popery</hi> become
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:117675:124"/> this City? They go in their <hi>beſt clothes,</hi> and make <hi>gallant chear,</hi> and they are ready to <hi>throw ſtones,</hi> if any <hi>open their ſhops.</hi> It is not the <hi>people</hi> ſo much; but where are our <hi>Prophets?</hi> they lie as if they were <hi>dead</hi> all the while. This is <hi>dealing falſly,</hi> it is not <hi>plain, ſquare dealing with God.</hi> If people did hate <hi>Schiſm,</hi> (as there are <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> I favor them not) they would hate <hi>prophaneneſs,</hi> and all other <hi>evils</hi> as well: But this is <hi>falſe dealing,</hi> and <hi>jugling;</hi> this ſhews their <hi>deſign:</hi> If they did <hi>hate one,</hi> they would <hi>hate all;</hi> if they did ſeek <hi>Reformation in one,</hi> they would <hi>ſeek it in all:</hi> But this is <hi>falſe dealing,</hi> the <hi>Prophets deal falſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then fourthly, here is the <hi>ſin of the people</hi> laid down, <hi>grievous revolting, horrible backſliding</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> the people grow <hi>worſe and worſe;</hi> it was time for <hi>God</hi> to take them in hand, in Verſe 28. <hi>This people are all grievous revolters:</hi> They <hi>were</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> but now they <hi>are revolted.</hi> In this City, four yeers ago, there was <hi>abundance of Reformation;</hi> how did people <hi>hugg poor Saints,</hi> when they were <hi>perſecuted</hi> in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries? they did <hi>cloath</hi> them, and <hi>feed</hi> them: And theſe <hi>Superſtitions</hi> of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> were almoſt quite out of the way; but we are <hi>gone back,</hi> we are as bad as we were twenty yeers ago. A poor <hi>Saint</hi> dares hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear at <hi>Guildhal,</hi> though he be not a <hi>member</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> yet they cry <hi>An Independent, an Independent;</hi> as if he were an <hi>Owl</hi> among <hi>Birds.</hi> And <hi>ſtrangers, godly men,</hi> that have ſeen us within this half yeer, they think we are <hi>grown mad,</hi> and have wiſhed, I would to <hi>God,</hi> I could get over the line to go home. <hi>London</hi> is grown the <hi>worſt place</hi> in the Kingdom; it was not ſo,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:117675:125"/> three or four yeers ago. Men did <hi>love the Saints,</hi> and were ready to <hi>ſave the Kingdom;</hi> but now there is a <hi>bitter root</hi> to <hi>deſtroy the Saints,</hi> and to lay <hi>ſtumbling blocks;</hi> we are <hi>grievous revolters.</hi> For matter of ſin, we are as like <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as may be.</p>
            <p>I, but will ſin <hi>deſtroy</hi> a people? I pray obſerve in the next place, The <hi>carriage of Jeruſalem</hi> under their <hi>ſins.</hi> What was that? There are three things laid down in their <hi>carriage:</hi> For it is not onely ſin that <hi>ruines men,</hi> but their <hi>carriage</hi> under it. It is not <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the water</hi> that drowns a man, but his <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or <hi>unskilfulneſs</hi> to get out.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, they were <hi>not aſhamed</hi> in the leaſt meaſure for all theſe things. <hi>Were they aſhamed?</hi> He puts it to the queſtion, and anſwers himſelf, <hi>Were they aſhamed, when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not aſhamed, neither could they bluſh, ſaith the Lord,</hi> for all this wickedneſs. <hi>Were they aſhamed?</hi> As if he had ſaid, If they had been <hi>aſhamed,</hi> I had been ſomewhat <hi>ſatisfied:</hi> If the people had <hi>mourned</hi> for their <hi>grievous revolting,</hi> and <hi>backſliding,</hi> and <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion,</hi> and <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> in the middeſt of them, it were ſome <hi>comfort;</hi> but <hi>they were not aſhamed, they cannot bluſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the ſecond thing is this, That as they could not be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> ſo they would not hear, nor receive any <hi>inſtructions</hi> to <hi>amend their ways;</hi> therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> would <hi>turn them as a diſh is turned, upſide down,</hi> Verſe 10. <hi>To whom ſhall I ſpeak, and give warning, that they may hear?</hi> Where is any Creature that will <hi>hear,</hi> notwithſtanding all this? <hi>Behold, their ear is uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and they cannot hearken: behold, the Word of</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:117675:125"/> 
               <hi>the Lord is unto them a reproach, they have no delight in it.</hi> This was their condition: The people were <hi>full of ſin,</hi> and they had <hi>no delight</hi> to hear the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſincerely to <hi>lay open</hi> their ſins; nay, it was a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach:</hi> they <hi>reproached</hi> the <hi>Miniſter</hi> that ſhould do ſo; they would <hi>queſtion</hi> him, and <hi>throw him into the dungeon,</hi> as they did <hi>Jeremy,</hi> for ſhewing them their ſins. So in Verſe 17. <hi>I ſet watchmen over you, ſaying, Hearken to the ſound of the trumpet; but they ſaid, We will not hearken:</hi> That is, They ſaid ſo in their <hi>hearts</hi> at leaſt. And ſo in Verſe 19. <hi>Hear O Earth, becauſe they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my Law, but rejected it.</hi> And judg whether this be not our condition.</p>
            <p>Then thirdly, and laſtly, This is the <hi>aggravation</hi> of their ſins; as they were not <hi>aſhamed,</hi> and would not <hi>hear</hi> one word. So laſtly, <hi>God</hi> was <hi>weary,</hi> as it were, he was tired with <hi>correcting</hi> and <hi>afflicting</hi> them, and yet they did not amend. For that is the drift of that place, Verſe 29. <hi>The bellows are burnt, the lead is conſumed of the fire, the founder melteth in vain;</hi> for the <hi>wicked,</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> or <hi>miſchief, is not plucked away.</hi> That is, ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> I was as a <hi>founder</hi> blowing with the bellows, till they were worn out: The very fire and all is conſumed, and the <hi>droſs</hi> is not taken away. Some particular men eſpecially have had many afflictions, and ſo after afflictions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others in the Kingdom: There have been <hi>touches</hi> of <hi>Gods rod;</hi> and truly we are <hi>worſe.</hi> Now thus you have the <hi>ſins</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>carriage</hi> of this people, under their ſins.</p>
            <p>In the next place, there is the <hi>dealing of God,</hi> with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:117675:126"/> this people, becauſe of their ſins. And the firſt thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>God prepares war:</hi> That is, ſet down from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chapter, to Verſe 7. <hi>Hew down trees, caſt a mount againſt</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>This is the City to be viſited, ſaith God. God</hi> comes to <hi>viſit Ieruſalem,</hi> he looks upon her, as if a Carpenter went to a Wood to chuſe Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. This is the <hi>Oke</hi> that will ſerve to make ſuch a beam. So <hi>God</hi> looks on all Countries, the <hi>Amonites,</hi> and <hi>Amorites, &amp;c.</hi> But this <hi>is the City fit for judgment;</hi> therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Hew down trees, prepare war.</hi> I will not be peremptory in this; but the <hi>Lord</hi> may do it: He hath done it with others, like our ſelves. <hi>Hew down trees, prepare war againſt this City.</hi> If the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>London is the City to be viſited, Briſtol</hi> hath been viſited, and moſt places in the Kingdom, but now <hi>London</hi> muſt; there my <hi>wrath</hi> ſhall be <hi>poured out.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> grant that it may not be ſo, but I greatly fear it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Lord</hi> brings them to <hi>impriſonment,</hi> the <hi>Lord took them priſoners,</hi> Verſe 11. <hi>The husband with the wife ſhall be taken; the aged with him that is full of days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then comes their <hi>plunder. Their houſes ſhall be turned to others, with their fields, and wives together: For I will ſtretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of this Land,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord.</hi> O, if the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>This is the City to be viſited,</hi> and <hi>make war againſt it,</hi> and then take you <hi>priſoners,</hi> take the <hi>aged men,</hi> the <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Common Councellers,</hi> and all <hi>priſoners;</hi> and then <hi>plunder</hi> all, and ſay; their <hi>fields,</hi> and their <hi>wives</hi> ſhall be turned to <hi>others:</hi> That were ſore, that you ſhould not onely loſe your <hi>goods,</hi> but your <hi>fields;</hi> that your
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:117675:126"/> 
               <hi>houſes,</hi> and <hi>trades,</hi> and <hi>ſhops,</hi> ſhould be taken away, and your very <hi>wives.</hi> Thus the <hi>Lord</hi> did with others, I will not ſay, that he will do ſo with you.</p>
            <p>Now, there were <hi>ſtumbling blocks</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was <hi>deſtroyed;</hi> ſo there are in this City; it is filled with <hi>ſtumbling blocks;</hi> every little <hi>difference</hi> in <hi>opinion</hi> is a <hi>ſtumbling block,</hi> that ſome men become <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> becauſe every <hi>Saint</hi> doth not <hi>agree</hi> one with another. And then there is the <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>horror</hi> that did fore-run this miſery, Verſe 24.</p>
            <p>But in a word, the <hi>courſe</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> would have them take; and that therefore I ſhall ſpeak of, that you may beſeech the <hi>Lord,</hi> that this poor <hi>City</hi> may <hi>prevent</hi> thoſe evils.</p>
            <p>One thing is, the <hi>Lord</hi> would have them <hi>ſeriouſly, and ſincerely humble themſelves before him,</hi> to <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg their ſins,</hi> and <hi>bewail them.</hi> Verſe 26. Saith the <hi>Lord, O daughter of my people, gird thee with ſackcloth, and wallow thy ſelf in aſhes; make thee mourning, as for an onely ſon.</hi> Not a <hi>formal</hi> day of <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation;</hi> for that is almoſt become <hi>all form:</hi> but <hi>really</hi> humble thy ſoul, and call upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> would be pleaſed to <hi>turn away</hi> his wrath.</p>
            <p>Then the ſecond thing laid down, is, That we ſhould hearken to inſtruction, <hi>Be thou inſtructed, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>leaſt my ſoul depart from thee;</hi> be ready to <hi>hear the Word of the Lord,</hi> be ready to <hi>hearken</hi> what <hi>Gods</hi> will is, how he may be <hi>glorified,</hi> and we <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then thirdly, here is a word that I exceedingly deſired to open, but I muſt but name it, Verſe 16. <hi>Stand ye in the ways and ſee, and ask for the old paths,</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:117675:127"/> 
               <hi>where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall finde reſt for your ſouls, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This is the way to ſave you, <hi>Stand in the wayes, ask for the old way.</hi> What is the meaning of the <hi>old way?</hi> That is, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> That was the <hi>old way</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and the way of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> and <hi>truth.</hi> He alludes, as I take it, to the <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> for that is called the <hi>old world,</hi> and the <hi>old way.</hi> Saith he, Ye are not like your <hi>fathers</hi> heretofore. <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was not <hi>covetous,</hi> and <hi>full of oppreſsion;</hi> they were <hi>willing to hear</hi> that which was for their good; and they were not the worſe for their <hi>afflictions.</hi> Look to the <hi>old way,</hi> and labor to get ſuch a Spirit as the <hi>Saints</hi> had heretofore, that were in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What of all this? notwithſtanding this counſel that the <hi>Lord</hi> had given them, what if they will <hi>not turn</hi> to him? what if they will <hi>not amend?</hi> Then there is a <hi>terrible word</hi> that we read of in Verſe 8. <hi>Leſt my ſoul depart from thee.</hi> It is not ſin onely that makes <hi>Gods</hi> ſoul depart from a people, nor their <hi>hardneſs,</hi> nor <hi>wickedneſs;</hi> but when they refuſe all <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>helps,</hi> then his <hi>ſoul departs from them.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>leſt my ſoul depart,</hi> or leſt my ſoul be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted,</hi> as it is in the Margin. What is the meaning of that? It is a <hi>terrible word;</hi> we have that word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 15. 1, 2. See what it is for to have <hi>Gods</hi> ſoul to <hi>go from</hi> a people. (I beleeve that <hi>Gods</hi> ſoul is <hi>not gone</hi> from us, if we will <hi>hearken</hi> to him, and do not give our ſelves up to <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>rage</hi> againſt <hi>Gods</hi> people.) <hi>Then ſaid the Lord to me, Though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood before me, yet my minde,</hi> or my ſoul, <hi>could not be towards this people.</hi> There is before the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:117675:127"/> 
               <hi>ferventeſt, bleſſed prayer</hi> for this people, that I know in the <hi>Book of God, Ieremy</hi> prayes: And now their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was coming, ſaith the <hi>Lord, Though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſhould come before me, my heart could not be on them.</hi> I have put them <hi>out of my heart,</hi> my <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> is gone from them, I will never be <hi>troubled</hi> more with them. What follows? <hi>Caſt them out of my ſight; let them go forth.</hi> And if they ſay, <hi>Whether ſhall we forth? Then thou ſhalt tell them, ſuch as are for death, to death, ſuch as are for the ſword, to the ſword, ſuch as are for the famine, to famine, and ſuch as are for captivity, to captivity.</hi> Let them go <hi>whether they will;</hi> ſome of them will be <hi>hanged,</hi> ſome <hi>killed,</hi> ſome to the <hi>ſword,</hi> ſome <hi>ſtarved;</hi> they can come to no good, becauſe they are gone out of my ſight: My <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> is from them; that is the <hi>laſt gaſp;</hi> that is <hi>hell</hi> above ground.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſum of all is, That we <hi>hearken to God;</hi> for theſe things were not written for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> onely; but for <hi>our inſtruction, God</hi> hath laid down their <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and their <hi>oppreſsion,</hi> and the <hi>bleſſed remedy,</hi> that they ſhould have taken; and if we take it not, but go on in our wickedneſs, we ſee what we may expect, That when that ſhall come on us (which <hi>God</hi> if it be his will forbid) you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you were told before.</p>
            <p>I have one thing in my ſad and ſerious thoughts, to comfort me, that this ſhall not befal this <hi>City,</hi> and that is this: That the <hi>Lord</hi> delt with them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and ſo went by Cities, and Nations; but now every man, and every perſon that calls upon <hi>God,</hi> is reſpected in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:117675:128"/> 
               <hi>every Nation,</hi> and <hi>City</hi> whatſoever. But this comes in, and <hi>cools</hi> it wonderfully, and puts me to a <hi>non-plus.</hi> If we in this City did go according to the <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> I am perſwaded, that the <hi>Lord</hi> would not ſend <hi>deſolation</hi> upon the <hi>City;</hi> but becauſe we would go according to that <hi>old ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,</hi> we have choſen it, and ſaid ſo, and do ſo: Now as they choſe that <hi>adminiſtration</hi> to <hi>deal with God,</hi> he choſe that to <hi>deal with them;</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> will deal <hi>frowardly</hi> with the <hi>froward,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> will deal with men according to their <hi>own law:</hi> Thoſe that ſin againſt the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> ſhall be puniſhed ſo; thoſe that ſin <hi>againſt the Law of Moſes,</hi> ſhall be puniſhed ſo; thoſe that go according to the <hi>adminiſtration of grace,</hi> ſhall be delt with accordingly. Now we are going according to the <hi>old adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> more and more; for we are ſetling like the Jews in an <hi>outward, formal Reformation,</hi> without heart. Now it would be terrible, if the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould chuſe our <hi>own adminiſtration,</hi> and give us according to our <hi>own heart,</hi> I hope he will not: But this lay heavy upon my <hi>ſpirit,</hi> to tell you of; therefore, the <hi>Lord</hi> direct you to make the <hi>beſt uſe</hi> you can, that if it be his <hi>bleſſed will,</hi> this <hi>place,</hi> that is the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>refuge</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> would not come againſt it.</p>
